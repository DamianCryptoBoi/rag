It is ,  wide and 64\u00a0m deep (from the deepest point of the bottom to the highest point of the rim).\n\nIna is remarkable for several dozens low hills with flat or rounded tops and very sharp rounded boundaries, looking like drops of mercury. Their surface looks like the usual surface of the Moon while the space between them is very different. Ina is the most prominent of several dozen similar features on the Moon. Their origin is unclear.\n\nDiscovery, exploration and naming\nIna was discovered on photographs taken in 1971 by the crew of Apollo 15 from lunar orbit. It could have been found 5 years earlier on images taken by Lunar Orbiter 4 had a photographic flaw not prevented this. At the end of 1972 Ina was observed and photographed by the crew of Apollo 17. After Apollo it was reconnoitred by several orbiting spacecraft beginning in 2009 when the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter obtained photos of Ina with resolution of about 0.5 m/pixel and with varying illumination angles.\n\nOn a topophotomap published in 1974 by NASA this feature was given the Latin female name Ina, in accordance with the convention to give small lunar craters human first names. In 1979 this name was adopted by the International Astronomical Union. In Apollo-era publications the feature is called D-caldera due to its shape, and at the time it was believed to be a unique feature on the moon.\n\nTwo neighbouring features were named in 1976. They are the small craters Osama on Ina's southwestern edge and Dag to its northwest (both 400\u00a0m in diameter). The widest hill in the eastern part of Ina (650\u00a0m wide) was named Mons Agnes in 1979.\n\nDescription\nIna is located on top of a rounded upland (dome) 300\u00a0m high and 15\u00a0km in diameter. It is situated on an elongated plateau (horst) about 30\u00a0km wide. This plateau stands in the middle of Lacus Felicitatis\u00a0\u2012 a small lunar lake between Mare Serenitatis, Mare Vaporum and Mare Imbrium."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.24503731207100788765833989033141266182", "context": "Ina is a D-shaped depression 2.9\u00a0km \u00d7 1.9\u00a0km wide. It has an elevated rim 600\u20131000\u00a0m wide and 30\u201340\u00a0m high. The eastern part of the rim is 10\u00a0m higher than the western. Its outer slope is very gently sloping (1\u00b0\u20133\u00b0) and lacks a distinct edge while the inner slope is very steep (tens of degrees) and has a very sharp border with the depression. The deepest point of the depression is located somewhat to the northwest of its center. This point is 30\u00a0m deeper than the edges of the depression and 64\u00a0m deeper than the highest point of the rim.\n\nThere are 2 clearly distinct types of surface inside Ina: hills and lowlands. The surface of the hills looks like the usual surface of Lacus Felicitatis while the surface of the lowlands is very different.\n\nThere are several dozen hills within Ina. They are diverse in size and have rounded amoeba-like edges, like drops of mercury. Many of them are interconnected with other hills or with the edge of the depression. They are rather low (5\u201325\u00a0m, usually 10\u201315\u00a0m). Their tops are flat or slightly rounded while their slopes are steep. The edges of the hills are usually very sharp. Often they are surrounded by a little moat. The boundary between the hills and the lowland has the same appearance as the outer boundary of the depression. The surface of the hills is very smooth compared to the lowlands. In addition, although the sample size is not great, the hills do have an impact crater density intermediate between the fresh lowlands and the ancient neighboring plains of Lacus Felicitatis.\n\nIna's lowlands are much rougher than its hills and show lots of small irregular relief features whose height is no more than several meters. Some craters are also discernible there. Some of the lowlands contain small patches with very bright tone. These are outcrops of scattered rocks  in size. Such patches are located mainly near the border between the lowlands and the hills, especially in the lowest places."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.66594943731077351617723697314887085380", "context": "Ina's lowlands are bright bluish-grey. The hills are darker and brown (the usual lunar surface colour). The lowlands resemble freshly exposed basalt with high titanium content like the basalt seen in some young impact craters. Ina is surrounded by a weak dark halo. The surface of its surroundings is slightly more blue than the more distant surface.\n\nAnalogs\n\nIna is the most prominent, large and well-known representative of a class of features called irregular mare patches, which are also known as \"meniscus hollows\" for the similarity of their edges to a convex meniscus. Several dozen such features are known on the Moon, all located on the maria. They are hypothesized to be volcanic in origin but several alternative hypotheses exist (see Origin below) and their origin is far from certain. Somewhat similar but distinct features, called hollows, are rather common on Mercury. These features differ from lunar meniscus hollows in having bright halos; they are also more widespread, often bigger and usually located in impact craters.\n\nInterpretations\n\nAge\nThe surface of Ina's lowlands seems to be much younger than the surface of its hills and outer surroundings. Evidence of this includes the light color and low concentration of craters on these lowlands. The Moon's surface darkens over time and multiple meteorite impacts dot it with craters, blur sharp edges of all relief features and make slopes more gentle. Ina seems to be one of the youngest features on the Moon. The surface of the hills is much older: its age seems to be roughly equal to the age of the usual surface of Lacus Felicitatis (more than 1 billion years) but the slopes and edges of these hills are young: they couldn't maintain their steepness and sharpness even for 50 million years. The dome on which Ina sits seems to be somewhat younger than its surroundings, judging from crater concentration."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.41187238673113431143302135734197882915", "context": "On the other hand, there is a lower estimate for the age of the tops of Ina's hills: 33\u00b12 million years (based on crater counts with the result of 137 craters/km2 for craters >10\u00a0m in diameter).\n\nThe latest research suggests Ina is not so young. The study looked at well-studied volcanoes on Earth that might be similar to Ina. Ina appears to be a pit crater on a shield volcano, a gently sloping mountain similar to the Kilauea volcano in Hawaii. Kilauea has a pit crater similar to Ina known as the Kilauea Iki crater, which last erupted in 1959.\n\nAs lava from that eruption solidified, it created a highly porous rock layer inside the pit with underground vesicles as large as three feet in diameter and surface void space as deep as two feet. That porous surface, Head and his colleagues say, is created by the nature of the lava erupted in the late stages of events like this. As the subsurface lava supply starts to diminish, it erupts as \"magmatic foam\" - a bubbly mixture of lava and gas. When that foam cools and solidifies it forms the highly porous surface.\n\nThe researchers suggest that an Ina eruption would also have produced magmatic foam. And because of the Moon's decreased gravity and nearly absent atmosphere the lunar foam would have been even fluffier than on Earth so it is expected that the structures within Ina are even more porous than on Earth.\n\nIt is the high porosity of those surfaces that throws off date estimates for Ina, both by hiding the buildup of regolith and by throwing off crater counts.\n\nA highly porous surface, the researchers say, would allow loose rock and dust to filter into surface void space, making it appear as though less regolith has built up. That process would be perpetuated by seismic shaking in the region, much of which is caused by ongoing meteor impacts. \"It's like banging on the side of a sieve to make the flour go through,\" Head said. \"Regolith is jostled into holes rather than sitting on the surface, which makes Ina look a lot younger.\""}, {"source": "bitagent.source.236597941126089953861298056044229325269", "context": "Porosity could also skew crater counts. Laboratory experiments using a high-speed projectile cannon have shown that impacts into porous targets make much smaller craters. Because of Ina's extreme porosity, the researchers say, its craters are much smaller than they would normally be, and many craters might not be visible at all. That could drastically alter the age estimate derived from crater counts.\n\nThe researchers estimate that the porous surface would reduce by a factor of three the size of craters on Ina's mounds. In other words, an impactor that would make a 100-foot-diameter crater in lunar basalt bedrock would make a crater of a little over 30\u00a0feet in a foam deposit.\n\nTaking that scaling relationship into account, the team gets a revised age for the Ina mounds of about 3.5 billion year. That's similar to the surface age of the volcanic shield that surrounds Ina, and places the Ina activity within the timeframe of common volcanism on the Moon.\n\nThe researchers believe this work offers a plausible explanation for Ina's formation without having to invoke the puzzling billion-year pause in volcanic activity.\n\n\"We think the young-looking features in Ina are the natural consequence of magmatic foam eruptions on the Moon,\" Head said. \"The landforms created by these foams simply look a lot younger than they are.\"\n\nOrigin\nIna's origin is unclear as of 2015. Firstly it was interpreted as a caldera of a very low ancient volcano. Another version considers it as a result of powerful ejection of some gases (volcanic or even radiogenic), which removed regolith.  In that case the hills are places where the original regolith was preserved.  The other hypothesis says that the hills are lava flows, inflated during growth under some dense coating. All these versions have flaws. In particular, Ina does not seem to have a ring of volcanic ejecta, and the volcanic activity on the Moon seems to have ceased a long time ago."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.309709412840331334448689588113192986920", "context": "According to one another version, Ina appeared (and continues to form) due to collapse of the regolith into some underground cavities. These may be ancient lava tubes or the result of evaporation of volatile compounds.

He was educated in Europe (Prague Conservatory, graduated 1961; Vienna Music Academy, graduated 1966; AMU Prague, graduated 1969). From 1960 to 1963, Kotik studied composition privately with Jan Rychl\u00edk in Prague, and from 1963 to 1966 at the Music Academy in Vienna with Karl Schieske, Hans Jelinek, and Friedrich Cerha. In Prague, he founded and directed Musica Viva Pragensis (1961\u201364) and the QUAX Ensemble (1966\u201369). He came to the United States in 1969 at the invitation of Lukas Foss and Lejaren Hiller to join the Center for Creative and Performing Arts at the University at Buffalo.\n\nSince 1983, Kotik has been living in New York City. Kotik is the founder and Artistic Director of the S.E.M. Ensemble, based in New York City, which presents both chamber and orchestra concerts. Kotik has received numerous commissions and composition grants, from the National Endowment for the Arts. Kotik received a 1996 Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award. He is also known for his realization of the complete musical works of Marcel Duchamp.\n\nWith the S.E.M. Ensemble (which he founded in 1970), Kotik has for many years actively promoted the work of other (mostly American) composers sharing a stylistic affinity with his own work, giving frequent performances as conductor and performer with the group as well as its larger version, the Orchestra of the S.E.M. Ensemble."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.305642751656703255263000841521799450988", "context": "Kotik's music is composed in the minimal vein, with works often being of long duration and featuring slow tempi and quiet dynamics. Though his works feature innumerable gradual, slight changes, giving them a seemingly static quality, his harmonies, however, are more complex than those employed by many other American minimal composers, and his musical process is not as apparent to the listener as, for example, in the works of Steve Reich or Philip Glass. Further, Kotik does not draw as heavily on jazz or rock in his works as do many of his American colleagues (though, like Steve Reich, he is quite interested in Medieval music and often integrates Medieval compositional techniques into his works). These qualities set Kotik's music apart from American minimal trends, giving his music a decidedly European character more similar in outlook to, for example, that of Hungarian minimalists such as Zolt\u00e1n Jeney, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 S\u00e1ry, or L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Vidovszky.\n\nAmong Kotik's best known works is the six-hour opera Many Many Women (1976\u201378), based on a text by Gertrude Stein, for whose work, appropriately, Kotik has a special affinity."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.272424914825096568401684552422891790546", "context": "As a performer, Kotik has been an active chamber musician throughout much of his life. Until 1992, Kotik did not have the slightest interest in orchestra. That changed in 1992, when he conducted Atlas Eclipticalis by John Cage with the 86-piece Orchestra of the S.E.M. Ensemble in Tribute to John Cage at Carnegie Hall, with David Tudor as the soloist. Since then, Kotik has been organizing large-scale events, expanding the S.E.M. Ensemble into The Orchestra of the S.E.M. Ensemble, and encouraging and commissioning other composers to write for orchestra. In 1999, after conducting Gruppen by Karlheinz Stockhausen, Kotik initiated a project of compositions for 3 orchestras and commissioned the creation of new 3-orchestra works by Alvin Lucier, Christian Wolff, Martin Smolka, Phill Niblock and Olga Neuwirth. In 2001, Kotik founded the biennial Ostrava Days, an Institute and Festival of New Music in Ostrava, Czech Republic. This three-week program, one of the largest in existence, focuses on works for orchestra, with two resident orchestras and number of resident composers, chamber music groups and soloists.\n\nAlthough Kotik entered the conservatory at the age of 14, he only began composing in his late teens. This was due to his lack of interest in classical harmony, a tendency shared with other composers such as Christian Wolff and John Cage. As a composer, Kotik is essentially self-taught, in spite of his education in Western composition fundamentals in Prague and Vienna. His technique has very little to do with commonly used compositional methods."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.259620428176093705016805465713777174344", "context": "Kotik's compositional system can be compared to a game in which the use of controlled chance is balanced by conscious decision-making. The two alternate, one influencing the other. In this way  Kotik triggers unpredictable processes while the work progresses in the envisioned direction. In recent years, Kotik has relied increasingly on intuitive gestures. The strategies and limitations Kotik imposes on chance, along with intuitive decisions, are at the root of his compositional process.\n \nAmong Kotik's best-known compositions are Music for 3 (1964) for piano and 2 strings; Spontano (1964) for piano and ensemble (composed for Frederic Rzewski); Kontrabandt (1967), a live electronic work commissioned by the WDR Electronic Music Studio; Many Many Women (1975\u201378) on a text by Gertrude Stein; and Letters to Olga (1988\u201391) on a text by V\u00e1clav Havel. His orchestra pieces include: Quiescent Form (1994\u201396); the one-hour-long Music in Two Movements (1998\u20132002); Variations for 3 Orchestras (2002\u20132005); and Spheres and Attraction (2005\u20132006) for 2 voices, string quartet and percussion on a text by R. Buckminster Fuller.\n \n\"Kotik\u2019s massive and too modestly named Fragment (1st movement of Music in Two Movements), which he conducted with his SEM Orchestra gives me sufficient pretext to voice the overdue sentiment that he is one of the best composers working today...among those writing abstract works for ensembles of unconventional instruments, Kotik stands very near the top and possibly at the top. He produced some of the most durable, though still little-known musical monuments of the post-Cage 70s, and his output has been amazingly consistent in quality.\u201d (New York music critic and composer Kyle Gann, The Village Voice 1998).\n\nKotik's music is available on the Labor, Dog w/a Bone and Ear-Rational labels."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.115696496302571531489863199066976644258", "context": "His father was the painter Jan Kot\u00edk.

These agreements also addressed how frequency assignments were distributed among the signatories, with a special emphasis on high-powered clear channel allocations. \n\nThe initial NARBA bandplan, also known as the \"Havana Treaty\", was signed by the United States, Canada, Mexico, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti on December 13, 1937, and took effect March 29, 1941. A series of modifications and adjustments followed, also under the NARBA name. NARBA's provisions were largely supplanted in 1983, with the adoption of the Regional Agreement for the Medium Frequency Broadcasting Service in Region 2 (Rio Agreement), which covered the entire Western hemisphere. However, current AM band assignments in North America largely reflect the standards first established by the NARBA agreements.\n\nBackground\n\nOrganized AM (mediumwave) radio broadcasting began in the early 1920s, and the United States soon dominated the North American airwaves, with more than 500 stations by the end of 1922. Due to a change in the ionosphere after the sun sets, nighttime signals from AM band stations are reflected for distances extending for hundreds of kilometers. This is valuable in providing radio programming to sparsely settled areas using high-powered transmitters. However, it also leads to the need for international cooperation in station assignments, to avoid mutually interfering signals."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.40737361072933572082927076249333638801", "context": "In an effort to rationalize assignments, a major reallocation went into force in the U.S. on November 11, 1928, following the standards set by the Federal Radio Commission's (FRC) General Order 40. At that time, the AM band was defined as 96 frequencies, running in 10 kilocycle-per-second (kHz) steps from 550 to 1500\u00a0kHz, which were divided into what became known as \"Local\", \"Regional\", and \"Clear Channel\" frequencies. The only provision the FRC made addressing international concerns was that six frequencies \u2014 690, 730, 840, 910, 960, and 1030 \u2014 were designated for exclusive Canadian use. On May 5, 1932, through an exchange of letters, the U.S. and Canada informally endorsed and expanded the 1928 standards, including recognition of Canadian use of 540\u00a0kHz. During the 1930s, Canada also began using 1510\u00a0kHz, while in 1934 the U.S. authorized two experimental high-fidelity stations on each of 1530 and 1550\u00a0kHz. By 1939, Cuban stations existed on frequencies as high as 1600\u00a0kHz.\n\nAs other countries, especially Mexico and Cuba, developed their own radio broadcasting services, the need arose to standardize engineering practices, reduce interference, and more fairly distribute clear channel assignments. Moreover, the development of better frequency control, and especially directional antennas, made it possible for additional stations to operate on the same or close by frequencies without significantly increasing interference. A key objective for the United States was that, in exchange for receiving clear channel assignments, Mexico would eliminate the high-powered English-language \"border blaster\" stations that had been directing their programming toward the U.S. and causing significant interference to U.S. and Canadian stations. However, an initial international meeting held in Mexico City in the summer of 1933 failed, primarily due to a lack of agreement over how many clear channel frequencies would be assigned to Mexico.\n\n1937 \"Havana Treaty\""}, {"source": "bitagent.source.99437993314035569453333845783901466374", "context": "In 1937, a series of radio conferences, this time successful, was held in Havana, Cuba, and the initial NARBA agreement was signed on December 13, 1937 by representatives from the United States, Canada, Cuba, Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Haiti. The most significant change was the formal addition of ten broadcasting frequencies, from 1510 to 1600\u00a0kHz, with the 106 available frequencies divided into Clear Channel (59 frequencies), Regional (41) and Local (6) designations. The official lower limit remained at 550\u00a0kHz, as it was not possible to add stations at the bottom of the broadcast band due to the need to protect 500\u00a0kHz \u2014 a maritime international distress frequency \u2014 from interference. (Although operation on 540\u00a0kHz was not covered by the Agreement, unofficially it became an additional Canadian clear channel frequency.)\n\nUnder the Agreement, most existing stations operating on 740\u00a0kHz or higher would have to change frequencies. Open frequencies were created throughout the band by \"stretching out\" the existing assignments, achieved by following a table which in most cases moved all the stations on a common frequency to a new, higher, dial position. This provided gaps of unassigned frequencies, most of which became clear channels allocated to Mexico and Canada. A majority of the frequency shifts were limited to between 10 and 30 kHz, which conserved the electrical height of a station's existing vertical radiator towers, an important factor for readjusting directional antenna parameters to accommodate the new frequency."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.31370344626295253879591251768933375912", "context": "Individual stations were specified to be Class I, II III or IV, with the class determining the maximum power a station could use and its interference protection standards. In all of the participating countries Class I and II stations were exclusively assigned to Clear Channel frequencies, while Class III was synonymous with a Regional frequency assignment. In the United States, Class IV stations were only assigned to Local frequencies, although in other countries they were assigned to both Local and Regional ones. A major change was the provision that some clear channels were allocated to be used simultaneously by two stations \u2014 those maintaining sole use of a frequency were classified as Class I-A, while stations sharing a clear channel were known as Class I-B. The Agreement assigned six Class I-A frequencies each to Mexico and Canada, and one to Cuba.\n\nReflecting the existence of improved radio design, the Agreement also reduced the \"same market\" minimum frequency separation from 50 to 40 kHz. (Mexico elected to further adopt a 30 kHz \"same market\" spacing, unless this was in conflict with an adjoining nation's \"border zone\" allocations.) This closer spacing was particularly important in the case of the two highest Local frequencies, 1420 and 1500\u00a0kHz, as stations on these frequencies were being moved to 1450 and 1490\u00a0kHz, a 40\u00a0kHz separation.\n\nAccording to the Agreement's provisions, its implementation was to take place within one year after its adoption by the pact's four main signatories \u2014 the United States, Canada, Cuba and Mexico.

His father was a guidance counselor at Gibbs Junior College and an administrator at St. Petersburg Junior College. He was also vice president of student affairs Palm Beach Junior College in Lake Worth, Florida. He died in 1979. His mother taught French and English at Sixteenth Street Junior High and Lakewood Senior High. She was a pioneer of integration in Pinellas County. She lived for a time in Minnesota where her leadership extended to many arenas: she was the first African American elected to the School Board for the Burnsville-Egan School District (in the Twin Cities metro), she co-founded the Dakota County Society of Black Women, and she served as interim director at Normandale Community College's women's center. She retired to Washington, D.C.\n\nRouson came to St. Petersburg at age three and lived in Cromwell Heights. He attended a Bishop Barry High School which later became St. Petersburg Catholic High School. He returned to New Orleans to attend college at Xavier University and graduated in 1977. He received his law degree from the University of Florida Spessard Holland Law Center in 1979. In 1980, he returned to St. Petersburg with a job at Gulfcoast Legal Services.

In 1987, he sold his practice and his home on Pinellas Point. He divorced his wife and left St. Petersburg. After some time, he met Reverend George Clements in Chicago. Reverend Clements was the founder of One Church-One Child, an adoption program. Rouson became the recovery revival coordinator for One Church-One Addict, a program that taught churches how to help recovering addicts. Rouson married a second time in 1991. His second wife developed breast cancer and died in 1997. He then returned to St. Petersburg in 1998.\n\nShortly after arriving in St. Petersburg Rouson experienced a brief period of homelessness. He went on to become active as a leader in the community. He became chairman of the St. Petersburg Area Black Chamber of Commerce, and he served on St. Petersburg's Charter Review Commission. He supported a substance abuse ministry at Mount Zion Progressive Missionary Baptist Church. He became the president of St. Petersburg branch of the NAACP in 2000. Rouson has said that this experience has helped him to understand the plight of the homeless and to endorse making homelessness a hate crime in Florida.\nOn August 16, 2017 Rouson was named Legislator of the year by the Florida Alliance for Assistive Services and Technology.\n\nActivism and law practice\nRouson's activism in the community and his law practice often involve his passions for civil rights and against drug addiction."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.9689362517734310199528285060890548309", "context": "In January 2000, Rouson was appointed to the St. Petersburg Charter Review Commission. The Council decided at the same session to award a $50,000 grant to the St. Petersburg Area Black Chamber of Commerce. The chamber had experienced financial difficulties since it was established in 1999. Rouson also became the president of the Chamber later in the month. His predecessor had co-mingled personal funds with that of the Chamber's in order to  maintain solvency, and Rouson sought to establish the financial integrity of the Chamber. He saw the Chamber as the NAACP's economic arm and as a partner with the St. Petersburg Area Chamber of Commerce. He set the chamber's goals at bringing more minority-owned businesses to St. Petersburg and attracting the convention of a national company.\n\nIn July 2000, as head of the Chamber, Rouson protested the treatment of African-American teenagers  at a local mall. In the late 1990s, several Tampa Bay Area malls, including Tyrone Square mall, developed dress codes to deter what they saw as gang activity. One of the concerns they had was with caps worn turned to one side. In July 2000, Tyrone mall's policy generated controversy after the son of a minister at Bethel Community Baptist Church was ejected. The boy's father felt the mall's actions were discriminatory, whereas the mall said it was simply providing for the safety of its patrons. Rouson went to the mall in an effort to \"test the policy.\" He too was asked to leave."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.143331025839127024304567299570036317920", "context": "In November 2000, he won an election as president of the St. Petersburg Chapter of the NAACP.

Omali Yeshitela, the group's leader, also denied that Rouson was a member. He did welcome what he perceived as needed change in the NAACP.\nAfter the election, Rouson said his goals were to continue to counter the effects of racism, eliminate substance abuse, improve economic development and double youth membership.\n\nThat same month, he represented a neighborhood association that was suing a motel on a nuisance complaint. The Fossil Park Neighborhood Association accused the owners of the motel of allowing it to be used as a crack house and providing a place for prostitutes to bring their clients. Complaints to the motel owners and to the police had been unavailing. Rouson said he saw the suit as an opportunity to continue his fight against drug abuse in the area.\nThe suit was settled two years later, with both sides bound by a gag order under the terms of the settlement.

Pinellas County created a program to help small businesses owned by minorities. The first African American was appointed to the St. Petersburg Times board of directors.

His achievements were tempered by some adversity. He declared bankruptcy to erase debts incurred before his return to St. Petersburg. He received a reprimand from the state bar in early 2001. During a criminal trial, he had surreptitiously gone through a report on the opposing counsel's table in the courtroom. He readily admitted he had made a mistake and apologized. Prosecutors said that he could have had access to the material merely by asking.\n\nIn October 2003, Rouson condemned the message sent by the Monopoly parody Ghettopoly and joined the president of the Hillsborough NAACP in demanding that the Urban Outfitters in Ybor City remove the game from its shelves. Although the game's creator claimed it was intended to be satirical, Rouson declared, \"There's nothing humorous or light about death and destruction that drugs and drug dealing cause in our neighborhoods that one should profit in parody.\""}, {"source": "bitagent.source.337374922805375378642383170603915842603", "context": "In January 2004, Rouson said he would not seek re-election as president of the St. Petersburg NAACP, citing the time the unpaid position took from his law practice and family.

By November, however, no one had stepped forward to replace him and he agreed to stay. In July 2005, he announced that he would be replaced by his assistant, vice-president Trenia Byrd-Cox. He had earlier advocated for the secession of Midtown from St. Petersburg in an effort to emphasize shortcomings in the status of African Americans in Pinellas County. However, he had backed away from the idea after recognizing its divisiveness.\n\nIn April 2005, while president of the St. Petersburg NAACP, Rouson stood trial on a charge of misdemeanor trespassing. In June 2004, he had entered into a conflict with the manager of a St. Petersburg tobacconist's shop, the Purple Haze. He claims to have strongly objected to the selling of what he condemned as drug paraphernalia, glass smoking pipes. Although ostensibly sold for use with tobacco, Rouson claimed it was common knowledge they were commonly used to smoke such illicit drugs as marijuana and cocaine, and decried the \"legal lie and deception\" that allows them to be sold. In court, the manager of the shop said anyone who talks about illegal drugs is asked to leave, and that Rouson had refused to do so. Rouson claimed that he tried to leave, but his way was blocked by two pit bulls. At trial, Rouson claimed he had gone to the store as an act of protest against the sale of what he called \"death utensils\".

The Commission meets every twenty years and is empowered to propose tax related changes to the State Constitution. In July 2007, he considered a run for State House District 55 as a Republican. Despite the district historically voting Democratic, Rouson was optimistic that his ties in Tallahassee and years of activism would give him the ability to win.\n\nHe again became a Democrat in 2007 to run in District 55 against two Democrats, City Council member Earnest Williams and activist Charles McKenzie, in the special primary leading up to the special election to replace Frank Peterman. Peterman had been appointed by Governor Crist to lead Florida's Department of Juvenile Justice.\n\nIn the special primary, Reverend Charles McKenzie, a coordinator for Rainbow/PUSH and educator, accused Rouson of being unfamiliar with the needs of residents of the southern part of District 55, in Manatee and Sarasota counties. Rouson denied this, saying residents of Newtown and Sarasota had the same problems as people living in Midtown and St. Petersburg.

She had filed a sexual harassment and racial bias suit against Florida Power Corp., but the suit was dismissed by the court. She also filed a complaint against Rouson, alleging that he had charged her an excessive fee. This complaint was dismissed by the State Bar. Rouson defeated Williams and McKenzie in the special primary with 44% of the vote.

Long. Rouson was supported in the primary election by pro-school voucher group, All Children Matter. They praised his work in the Legislature, and they denied that his efforts as a member of the Florida Taxation and Budget Reform Commission were considerations. However, while on the Commission, he voted to place two amendments on the ballot that would allow religion based schools to receive taxpayer support.\n\nMcKenzie again opposed Rouson in the regular primary. He criticized Rouson's support of a proposed amendment to the State Constitution which he said would hurt public education. Rouson said he wanted to reduce taxes and felt the proposed amendment should go to referendum to let the voters decide. McKenzie claimed he looked forward to improving teachers salaries, making changes in FCAT and reworking Florida's system for delivering health care to children.

In contrast, the process by which Common Lymphoid Progenitor (CLP) cells may differentiate to generate dendritic cells of lymphoid lineage is not yet well defined.\n\n2. **Granules**: NK cells are unique among lymphocytes because they have numerous granules, which provide their ability to kill cells. Dendritic cells, on the other hand, do not have visible granules.\n\n3. **Functions**: NK cells are primarily known for their cytolytic capacity, or the ability to lyse cells, such as cancer or virus-infected cells. A smaller subset of NK cells, called NK 'CD56 bright', is chiefly responsible for cytokine production and has enhanced survival. Dendritic cells, however, are highly specialized and efficient antigen-presenting cells, playing a crucial role in the adaptive immune response.\n\n4. **Migration**: After maturation, NK cells circulate in the blood throughout their lifetime seeking opportunities to recognize and kill abnormal cells. Dendritic cells, on the other hand, migrate from the site of antigen uptake to the lymph nodes, where they present antigens to T cells.\n\nAs for where NK cells primarily develop, while the majority of NK cells develop in the bone marrow, the exact organ or organs where NK cells primarily develop is not well understood. It is known that NK progenitors can be found in the thymus (in mice), but the thymus is not absolutely required for NK development.

They have a barcode definition as CD3, CD16+, CD56+ lymphocytes. NK cells develop in the bone marrow and circulate in the blood. They have the function to recognize and kill abnormal cells such as cancer or virally infected cells. On the other hand, dendritic cells (DCs) are highly specialized antigen-presenting cells that come from both a myeloid lineage (referred to as myeloid dendritic cells) and a lymphoid lineage (referred to as plasmacytoid dendritic cells). The development and regulation of DC is not well-characterized, but they are dispatched throughout the body, especially at epithelia such as skin, to monitor invaders and present their antigens.

A brother, Paul, was born six years later. He went to Erasmus Hall High School, graduating in 1947. For two years he attended Brooklyn College, then transferred to the University of Denver \"because of a desire to be on my own, to get away from the hay fever I suffered from in NY, and because Gary was there.\" (Gary Baden was one of his best friends in high school.)\n\nInitially, Panish specialized in organic chemistry. He had been strongly influenced by a book he read at the age of 12, Microbe Hunters by Paul de Kruif, which left him with the impression that a scientific career is exciting; and in his final year of high school, he had a substitute teacher for chemistry who was a chemistry graduate student from Columbia University. Panish was fascinated by the teacher's description of his Ph.D. work, which involved synthesizing new organic compounds. He met his future wife, Evelyn Chaim, in an organic chemistry class at Denver University. However, he was attracted to the more mathematical discipline of physical chemistry, which he thought more challenging, and in the end this is what he specialized in. He graduated in 1950."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.197761454023899331489403897541522050610", "context": "Panish enrolled in graduate school at Michigan State University, majoring in physical chemistry and minoring in organic chemistry. His master's thesis involved a \"series of measurements of the electric dipole behavior of some organic compounds,\" and he did not consider it very challenging. His advisor was Max Rogers, a Canadian and former student of Linus Pauling, and Rogers supervised his Ph.D. work as well, which was on interhalogen compounds. Used to process reactor fuels, these compounds are highly reactive and dangerous, and after Panish had completed his experiments another student was badly injured in an explosion. Panish resolved to work with less dangerous materials in future.\n\nFrom 1954 to 1957 Panish worked for Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, studying the chemical thermodynamics of molten salts. Then he moved to Massachusetts and worked in the Research and Advanced Development Division of AVCO Corporation. The primary contract of this division, with the United States Air Force, was to develop vehicles for the reentry of thermonuclear weapons into the atmosphere. Panish was unwilling to do this work, but the government allotted 5% of the budget to basic research. From 1957 to 1964 he worked on the chemical thermodynamics of refractory compounds, but then decided to leave because the government terminated the funding for basic research.\n\nBell Labs\n\nBefore the Oak Ridge job, Panish had applied to Bell Labs and been rejected, but now they hired him. He started work in June 1964 in the Solid State Electronics Research Laboratory, a group headed by physicist John Galt. He was part of a department working on III-V semiconductors, compounds in which elements from group III and group V of the periodic table are combined, for example, gallium arsenide (GaAs). He planned a series of experiments to look into controlling the impurity elements that determine the electrical properties of the semiconductors."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.1884826548185241781488544885967286520", "context": "In 1966, Galt asked Panish and Izuo Hayashi, a physicist from Japan, to investigate a problem involving laser diodes. The first such lasers, also known as injection lasers, were developed independently in 1962 by General Electric groups in Syracuse and Schenectady as well as the Thomas J. Watson Research Center of IBM and the MIT Lincoln Laboratory. These early lasers, mostly made out of a single chunk of GaAs, required high current densities to operate, so they could only run continuously at very low temperatures; at room temperature, they could only operate for a fraction of a second. For them to be used in a practical communications system, they would need to operate continuously at room temperature."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.245333648353417516342214329300220393675", "context": "A solution to the problem was proposed theoretically by Herbert Kroemer in 1963 \u2013 a double heterojunction laser but failed to suggest a suitable (lattice matched) combination semiconductors. The combination of such materials used for the first CW lasers was GaAs (Gallium Arsenide) and Aluminum Gallium Arsenide. The idea was to place a material like GaAs, with a smaller band gap, between two layers of a material such as aluminum gallium arsenide (a solid solution of AlAs and GaAs) that had a larger band gap; this confined the charge carriers and the optical field (the light) to this layer, reducing the current needed for lasing. Panish and Izuo Hayashi independently developed first the single heterostructure laser and then the double heterostructure laser. However, publication of the announcement of the first room temperature continuously operating double heterostructure  laser was by Zhores Alferov in 1970 one month before Hayashi and Panish published similar results. Although there was some degree of contact between the group in Leningrad  and the group in New Jersey including a visit by Alferov to the New Jersey lab, the two achievements were obtained independently.  Panish experimented with making wafers using a new form of liquid-phase epitaxy while Hayashi tested the laser properties. Panish and Hayashi observed what they thought might be CW operation in several wafers in the weeks before their final demonstration. That had to await a laser that lived long enough for a complete plot of the lasing spectrum to be achieved. Over the Memorial Day weekend in 1970, while Panish was at home, Hayashi tried a diode and it emitted a continuous-wave beam at just over 24 degrees Celsius and he was able to plot the complete spectrum with the very slow equipment available at the time. He left a note on Panish's door: \"C. W. definite!! at 24\u00b0C 10:30 A.M.

This is supposed to be inserted at 23:59:03, during minute 59 of the hour (during which the timestamp for minute :00 is transmitted), so that the minute markers are all broadcast at the correct times, but for the leap second at the end of December 2016, it was apparently inserted at 23:58:03.\n\nThe relative uncertainty of the carrier frequency is 2 parts in 1012.\n\nPhase modulation pattern\nOne signal element consists of the phase of the carrier shifted linearly by +1\u00a0rad in 25\u00a0ms (known as \"ramp A\"), then shifted linearly by \u22122\u00a0rad over 50\u00a0ms (\"ramp B\"), then shifted linearly again by +1\u00a0rad for another 25\u00a0ms (\"ramp C\"), returning the phase to zero. One signal element is always sent at each second between 0 and 58. Two signal elements are sent in sequence to represent a binary one; otherwise it is interpreted as binary zero.  During ramp B of the initial signal element, the exact point the signal phase is at zero represents the top of the UTC second.  Since the phase is the integral of the frequency, this triangular phase modulation at 40\u00a0rad/s corresponds to a square frequency modulation with a deviation of 20/\u03c0 \u2248 6.37\u00a0Hz.\n\nBoth the average phase and the average frequency deviation are thus zero.  Additional non-timing data is sent by phase modulation during the rest of each second.  But the second marker (and data bit) is always preceded by 100 ms without any phase modulation.  The signal is not phase-modulated at all during the 59th second past the minute.\n\nSee also\n Loop antenna\n Allouis longwave transmitter, the facility used for its transmission.\n T\u00e9l\u00e9Diffusion de France (also known as the TDF Group)\n\nReferences"}, {"source": "bitagent.source.199206109348033201148815983696475807215", "context": "Sources\n \n David L.

Since its rapid globalisation and democratisation, the unemployment rate has been comparatively low compared to most OECD countries. This remains the case as of 2021.

By comparison, the \u2018economically inactive\u2019 population refers to people aged 15 or older who are neither employed nor unemployed during the survey reference period.\n\nHistory and development \nSince undergoing rapid economic development in the 1960s, the Republic of Korea's unemployment rate had been consistently low After processes of democratization in the late 1980s, Korea saw a sharp increase in labour participation, and hence a lowered unemployment rate. From the 1980s until the 1998 Asian Financial Crisis, the unemployment rate averaged approximately 2.3 per cent. The 1998 Asian Financial Crisis saw the unemployment rate skyrocket to 7 per cent, totalling 1,490,000 people. Comparatively, the 2008 Global Financial Crisis had minimal effect on South Korea, with the unemployment rate rising from 3.16 per cent to 3.64 per cent. From 2008 to 2013, the unemployment rate remained relatively steady, averaging at 3.4 per cent. As of December 2021, the rate was 3.7 per cent, in line with the average of the previous two decades.\n\nRepublic of Korea unemployment rate\nThe Republic of Korea unemployment rate as of April 2019 is 4.8 per cent, or 1,197,000 people\n\nCauses"}, {"source": "bitagent.source.24224284331489829726901594870425971144", "context": "Economic performance\nIn 1953, the Republic of Korea passed the Labour Standard Act in order to protect workers\u2019 rights. Despite this, a minimum wage was not regulated until 1986. The minimum wage was then raised in 2001 by 16.8%, and again in 2018 by 16.4%, to 7530 won (US$7.03) per hour. Most recently, it was raised in January 2019 to 8350 won (US$7.46) per hour. This is argued to have led to a drop in low-paying jobs across many different sectors. Jobs in manufacturing declined by 170,000 jobs in a year. The construction sector lost 19,000 jobs, and the retail sector cut 67,000 jobs. With many companies using the raising minimum wage to cut various traditionally low-paying jobs due to rising costs of labour, the unemployment rate has risen to reflect this concept. Lobby groups representing many small-businesses within the country have since made statements saying that they will not accept the raise in minimum wage due to them needing to cut staff jobs in order to make a profit. As of 2021, these effects were gone and the hike in the minimum wage had had no discernible impact on employment.\n\nOutsourcing\nOutsourcing is the collection of goods by contract from an outside supplier. At 22% in 2015, the rate of temporary, outsourced contract workers in the Republic of Korea was double the OECD average. Workers under these systems are also earning 54% of what regular employees earn from similar work. Furthermore, there is critical concern that current labour protection mechanisms do not serve to protect these new types of workers. This, combined with the idea that contracts will end once the task is completed, contributes immensely to the growing unemployment rate at any one time of survey."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.9200040196723289985297707904066174857", "context": "Outsourcing also involves moving business overseas. The continuous increase of the minimum wage in the Republic of Korea has prompted firms to relocate their factories overseas to lower-wage rate countries in order to save costs. This is called the \"macroeconomic theory of internalisation\". Korean technology company Samsung Electronics has suffered from a \"technological hollowing out\" (\uae30\uc220 \uacf5\ub3d9\ud654) and \"technological disconnection (\uae30\uc220 \ub2e8\uc808). \"Technological hollowing out\" is defined as a situation in which essential parts of a technological creation process are not available inside a home/domestic territory. \"Technological disconnection\" refers to a situation where specific technologies or manpower are available in the domestic territory, however there is no successor to that information, thus ending the execution of the technological product. Samsung has recently generated a substantial amount of media coverage for outsourcing to China, where workers are paid less for longer hours. As a result of this outsourcing there has been a steady decrease of labouring jobs on the production lines of Samsung and other bigger production companies.\n\nTechnology\n\nSouth Korea is at the top of the International Federation of Robotics (IFR)\u2019s robot density list - 631 robots per 10,000 employees. For example, Lotte Department Stores, one of the largest retailers in Korea, has recently built a technologically-driven counter service system, replacing sales staff. The automation of these jobs has driven workers to jobs that are not yet automated, making it extremely competitive to be hired. For jobs that do not require qualifications, such as basic hospitality jobs, there could be one availability for 4500 applicants.\n\nDespite the rapid technological advancements of workplaces in South Korea, In January 2019 it was reported that the ICT sector had gained 94,000 new job openings in that month alone."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.106878545527535000697935072924645007415", "context": "Gender inequality\nA multitude of practices concerning gender inequality has led to a larger unemployment rate of women in the workforce of South Korea. Employment discrimination, private sector policies and a lack of women's bargaining power in employee relations emphasised by both State and private policy all contribute to the unemployment rate. In 2010, Korea had the third-lowest gender gap in employment out of 34 OECD countries, with 62.3% of women between the ages of 25 and 65 employed. Economists put this large gap down to traditional Confucian beliefs continuing to hold strong within Korean society, where the family unit is the most important aspect of one's life. This belief fosters continued gender segregation in the labour force. Combined with a lack of childcare centres, difficulties negotiating wage, and an already-existing gender wage gap, South Korean women are vastly under-employed.\n\nPreference for higher education \nThe Republic of Korea maintains one of the highest rates of educated populations in the world. According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), approximately 70 per-cent of 25-34 year olds in the Republic of Korea have completed some form of tertiary education.  Between the early 1980s and mid-2000s, the country's tertiary education rate had increased to five times its original rate. The graduates of top Korean Universities overwhelmingly hold high-ranking positions within government, business and industry. This devotion to learning, however, skews the unemployment rate as many young adults because technically unemployed due to their decisions to remain in schooling. The hyper-competitive nature of the Korean education system prompts some students to study over 16 hours a day at school, before-school and after-school programs called hagwons (\ud559\uc6d0). As a result, students that also hold jobs are rare, vastly increasing the unemployment rate."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.297146130810714085697147721661109590267", "context": "Measurement differences \nThe methods used to measure the Korean unemployment rate, as measured by Statistics Korea, is slightly different to the method used by other OECD countries.

Individuals over the age of 15 who are neither employed nor unemployed, housewives who primarily act as caregivers, students attending school, and volunteers are included in the 'economically inactive' population and do not contribute to the official unemployment rate.\n\nA large difference occurs when considering 'unpaid family workers'. In accordance with the International Labour Organisation standards, unpaid family workers who work more than one hour per week are categorised as employed. However, the official Korean measurement will only consider unpaid family workers to be employed if they work more than 18 hours in any given week. The individuals who fall into this 17-hour difference between the two measurements are classified to be within the Republic of Korea's 'economically inactive' population. When unpaid family workers are included in calculations in accordance with the International Labour Organisation, the unemployment rate decreases by approximately 0.1 per cent and the employment rate increases by about 0.4 per cent.\n\nUnder the International Labour Organisation Standards, individuals who are awaiting assignment from their companies, are seasonal workers not immediately working or who are in similar situations are considered to be employed depending on the specific company they work for.

Michael decides to quit his job and escape the city to return his mother to her birthplace, which she says was Prince Albert.\n\nMichael finds himself unable to obtain the proper permits for travel out of the city so he builds a shoddy rickshaw to carry his mother, and they go on their way.  Soon after escaping, Michael's mother dies in a hospital.  He lingers for some time, carrying his mother's ashes around with him in a box.  Finally, Michael decides to continue on his journey to Prince Albert to deliver his mother's ashes.  Along the way, though, he is detained for not having the required travel papers, thus being assigned to work detail on a railway track.\n\nAfter his job on the railway track is finished, Michael makes his way to the farm his mother spoke of on Prince Albert.  The farm is abandoned and desolate.  Soon, Michael discovers how to live off the land.  However, when one of the relatives of the legal owners of the farm arrives, he treats Michael like a servant.  Michael dislikes this treatment so he escapes up into the mountains."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.10986639833572401151703692067791920183", "context": "In the mountains, Michael goes through a period of starvation while he becomes aware of his surroundings.  In his malnourished state he finds his way down to a town where he is picked up by the police and is sent to a work camp.  Here, Michael meets a man named Robert.  Robert explains that the workers in the camp are exploited for cheap labor by the townspeople.  Eventually, there is an attack on Prince Albert and the workers of the camp are blamed.  The local police captain takes over and Michael escapes.\n\nMichael finds his way back to the farm but soon feels claustrophobic within the house.  Therefore, he builds a shelter in the open where he is able to watch his garden.  Rebels come out of the mountains and use his garden.  Although Michael is angered by this he stays in hiding.  Michael becomes malnourished and delirious again because he has not come out of hiding.  He is found by some soldiers and is taken to a rehabilitation camp in Cape Town. It is here that Michael is identified as \"CM,\" an abbreviation most likely signifying \"colored male.\"\n\nAt the rehabilitation camp, a doctor becomes interested in Michael.  He finds Michael's simple nature extremely fascinating and finds him to be unfairly accused of aiding rebels.  Michael becomes very sick and delirious because he refuses to eat.  The doctor tries to understand Michael's stubborn ways while attempting to get Michael released.  However, Michael escapes on his own.\n\nUpon his escape, Michael meets with a group of nomadic people who feed him and introduce him to a woman who has sex with him.  He returns to the apartment where he and his mother lived in Cape Town, the same apartment and city he had tried to escape some time ago.  Michael reflects on the garden he made in Prince Albert."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.298015866750800939320477248705959514200", "context": "Some commentators notice a connection between the character Michael K and the protagonist Josef K. in The Trial by Franz Kafka. The book also bears many references to Kafka, and it is believed, \"K\" is a tribute to Kafka. Comparisons have also been drawn between the novel and Heinrich von Kleist's novella Michael Kohlhaas, based upon the protagonist's name and similarities of plot, though it is often suggested that Coetzee's work is an antithetical response.\n\nMajor character analysis\n\nMichael K (K)\nA simple man born in South Africa, K bears the deformity of a cleft lip. K's central role is underscored by his appearance\u2014he is deformed and because of this, people look down upon him. His mother, the police, and Visagie's grandson all treat him with respect of a lesser human on the basis that he looks and acts slow. This is shown by the fact that K's mother institutionalizes him until she needs him, the police let him wander around unnoticed because he has a childish innocence, and Visagie's grandson treats him as a common servant.\n\nBut K is also dedicated to being true to his beliefs. When K's mother becomes very ill, he dedicates his life to taking her home at whatever the cost. And when she dies along the way, K continues to show his dedication by carrying her ashes all the way to Prince Albert so she can finally be home.\n\nWhen K is institutionalized he becomes a gardener, where he learns to enjoy isolation and the freedom it grants him. We see K's isolation and freedom continue throughout the book, starting at the Visagie's house where he first begins to learn to live off the land.  But when his freedom is encroached on, K flees even further from society, maintaining his freewill. In the mountains he understands how he wants to live his life, which involves only eating food he has grown from the Earth. K ultimately returns to Cape Town and to his mother's old apartment, never giving up his longing for freedom."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.293346144459011620603284556469303557487", "context": "Anna K\nMichael K's mother disliked him since she saw his disfigurement. Anna put K into a government institution and ignored him until she had no one else to turn to because of her health. Though she seems to have been uncaring and absent during his childhood, K shows his unconditional love for her by taking care of her until her death. Anna lived her life in fear: fear of losing her job, getting sick, or being put out on the street.\n\nThe Medical Officer\nThe infirmary medical officer at the rehabilitation camp is responsible for taking care of K when he is brought in. The medical officer was the only one of the staff at the hospital to realize K is an innocent civilian, being unfairly treated for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. The medical officer becomes fascinated by K and his childish nature and his reasons for not eating.\n\nThe medical officer originally thinks K wants to kill himself \u2014 hence his reason for not eating \u2014 but he comes to understand that K does want to live, just on his own terms. After K's escape, the medical officer realizes that because the camp is becoming under more strict military control, he is envious of K's freedom. K changes the medical officer's outlook on life: the medical officer fantasizes about following K and begging K to let him live like him.\n\nThemes"}, {"source": "bitagent.source.320223865612519640217235350487574667559", "context": "The value of human life\nMichael K is often seen as a parasite, or unskilled worker throughout this book. He doesn't have a very high social status and he is aware of that. At times he purposely acts dumb, like not speaking, because he knows he can get away with it. However, Michael knows that he still has a purpose in this world but it takes him the whole book to discover what that purpose is. He spends his time living off the land one day at a time. He doesn't realize until later that he was born to be a gardener. The goal of his journey is not to find his purpose but to assist his mother and fulfill her wishes, what he believed to be his original purpose in life. Michael happens to stumble upon his gardening skills by doing what he had to for survival. He loves his life as a gardener and realizes that most other people wouldn't be able to survive as he did. There are times where he questions his love for gardening when others tell him that he should be a fencer, just as everyone questions if they're making the right choice. He believes that,\"A man must live so that he leaves no trace of his living.\" Becoming a gardener is Michael's best bet for living out his philosophy.\n\nMother/Son enmeshment\nMichael is closely emotionally attached to his mother, such that he is unable to express an emotional response to the world outside of this relationship. He is held within the matrix of this relationship, and having never learned to engage with the world outside, expresses great distress whenever challenged to do so. The medical officer sums up this relationship, writing to Michael, \"[...] you should have got away at an early age from that mother of yours, who sounds like a real killer. [...] [Whilst] performing all the other feats of filial piety you no doubt performed, I also think of her sitting on your shoulders, eating out your brains, glaring about triumphantly, the very embodiment of great Mother Death.\" Michael exhibits some growth at the end of the story, through contact with kind peers."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.272079242887117035663078114319017206149", "context": "Time\nIn the conclusion, Michael ponders whether the moral of his story is \"that there is enough time for everything.\" The concept of time is present throughout the whole novel. The book ends with a metaphor: \"[H]e would lower [the spoon] down the shaft deep into the earth, and when he brought it up there would be water in the bowl of the spoon; and in that way, he would say, one can live.\"\n\nWar and military authority\nThe novel takes place in South Africa during a civil war in the 1970-80s, and K often crosses paths with soldiers throughout the story. These tend, based on flimsy or non-existent evidence, to accuse K and other people of various crimes such as theft or sabotage, while themselves performing corresponding acts of aggression with impunity. K is also more than once drafted into forced labour and placed in camps that vaguely resemble concentration camps. The inmates are given food, but eventually K rejects it. This appears to be a passive resistance to internment and arbitrary authority, though K may be only vaguely aware of his motives. He grows weaker and weaker until he finally escapes. Later on he is taken to a hospital instead, because he is too weak to work. He is better treated here, but nevertheless again refuses to eat and escapes. He does not evince much interest in the war, except as the soldiers pose a threat to him, from which he must hide or risk repeated internment or violence.\n\nRace\nThe story, which takes place during the apartheid regime and related racial conflicts, makes a reference to race, specifically, that there is a war \"so that minorities can have a say in their own destinies.\" This line, spoken by a character in the hospital Michael stays in, implies Michael interacts with soldiers in the white side of a war between races in South Africa. It is also implied at various points that this side is losing the war."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.178053716229694429147378255837581896835", "context": "The only other instance race is specified is in Part 1 of the novel, \"Michael Visagie--CM--40--NFA--Unemployed\". \"CM\" stands for \"colored male\" therefore telling the reader that Michael \"Visagie\" (which isn't Michael's surname) is an unemployed, 40-year-old, colored male with No Fixed Address.

In Humphrey's Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), the Court distinguished between executive officers and quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial officers by stating that the former serve at the pleasure of the president and may be removed at his discretion. The latter are removed only with procedures consistent with statutory conditions enacted by Congress. The decision by the Court was that the Federal Trade Commission was a quasi-legislative body because of other powers it had, and therefore, the president could not fire an FTC member for political reasons. Congress can't retain removal power over officials with executive function (Bowsher v. Synar). However, statutes can restrict removal if not purely executive (Humphrey\u2019s executor), but can't restrict removal of purely executive officer (Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926)).

In many insurance policies, executive officer means, in the case of a corporation, any chairman, chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief operating officer, president, or general counsel. In the case of a sole proprietorship, an executive officer is the sole proprietor. In the case of a partnership, an executive officer is a managing partner, senior partner, or administrative partner.

The outcome of the riot included $200 to $300 worth of damage, injuries to three prison officers, three prisoners, and a detective, and the transfer of around 60 men who had not taken part in the riot to other prisons. This event relates to the previous prison riots in 1854, 1898, 1902, and 1909 in that it demonstrates the ongoing issues of prison conditions and the potential for riots due to these issues. The 1988 riot also led to extensive media attention and a report on the risk of such an event.", "citations": ["bitagent.source.178543114333678355132716425487147334252", "bitagent.source.187008047251456938083649697897361901305", "bitagent.source.148295819338257796701120891418828402536", "bitagent.source.317713650918812002962913843545335995111", "bitagent.source.24572197887227155026675404569820347280"], "process_time": 11.714175462722778, "citation_rate": 1.0, "relevent_content": true, "unique_response": null, "correct_response": true}, {"write_question": "What significant role did Dr. Douglas Conner play in the life of Richard E.

Chicago, Feb. 17, 1944) is an American medical doctor who specialized in emergency department medicine. As a third-year college student, in 1965 he enrolled in the previously segregated Mississippi State University. He was one of five black Mississippians who pioneered the effort to desegregate the major state universities of Mississippi as part of the Civil Rights Movement. Following passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, his enrollment was the most peaceful of these efforts to that point.\n\nHolmes completed his college degree and graduated from MSU. After service in the United States Army, he also earned a master's degree in related fields, and a medical degree, the latter at Michigan State University. Holmes practiced emergency department medicine in hospitals in Birmingham, Alabama. In 2003 he returned to MSU to become a staff physician at the university's health center. He has received considerable recognition related to the 40th anniversary of his landmark enrollment and graduation from the university.\n\nEarly life and education\nRichard E. Holmes was born in Chicago, Illinois to Horace and Minnie Holmes on February 17, 1944. He had three older brothers. When Richard was 18 months old, he and his brothers were taken to Mississippi by their mother when the parents separated. They settled in Starkville, Mississippi, with Eliza Hunter, a family friend Holmes would consider his \"grandmother.\" Mrs. Hunter promoted education, hard work, honesty, and religion for the boys, teaching them that \"being poor and black was no reason for failure.\"\n\nBefore Mrs. Hunter died in 1956 at the age of 86, she arranged for Holmes (then age 12) to live with Dr. Douglas Conner and his wife. He was a local Starkville physician, African-American community leader and civil rights activist.

Holmes took pre-med courses during the two years he studied there. Wiley is a private, historically black college in Marshall, Texas; many of its students and faculty were active in the civil rights movement in Texas.\n\nCivil rights leaders James L. Farmer, Sr. and his son James Farmer (who was director of CORE when Holmes was at Wiley) both had connections to Wiley. Holmes was influenced by mentors who exemplified the philosophy of persistent but conservative, gradual expansion of civil rights, along with the need for racial reconciliation.\n\nCivil rights activism and integration\nHolmes may have questioned why he was studying at Wiley in Texas when MSU was located in his hometown. He likely had some concern for his safety considering the violence that had greeted Clyde Kennard (imprisoned on false grounds and dying) and James Meredith (placed in danger of his life during riots) when they attempted to integrate Mississippi universities.\n\nIn 1960 Clyde Kennard had been imprisoned on false charges by the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission and the administration of president William David McCain when trying to integrate the University of Southern Mississippi. White segregationists erupted into riots on the campus of the University of Mississippi in 1963 when a federal court ordered that James Meredith be admitted.  Governor Ross Barnett had gained political points in the state for his refusal to concede, and President John F. Kennedy authorized National Guard troops to quell the rioting and protect Meredith."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.307071804573738550971452677278798327441", "context": "It is not documented as to how Holmes became the first black student to enroll at Mississippi State. His decision likely had several origins: himself, perhaps his mentor Dr. Conner, the local NAACP, President Dr. Dean W. Colvard and members of the university administration, and friends and mentors at Wiley.\nThe NAACP had sponsored such efforts before; two months later they supported  the enrollments of Raylawni Branch and Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong at the University of Southern Mississippi.\n\nBy 1965, both liberals and segregationists in the Mississippi higher education community began to work toward integration. The Colvard administration was moderate for its time and place. In 1963, Dr. Colvard had been courageous enough to send his regional champion basketball team to the integrated NCAA championships, rejecting the desire by the white state political establishment to keep them out of the games because of racial issue. In 1965, Colvard, his staff, and the faculty were seeking a path to peaceful integration.\n\nHolmes enrolled for summer semester in July, when the fewest people would be on campus. He told the admissions office that he had come only for the one summer semester and would return to Wiley in the fall. He was always quiet and courteous, working to prevent any potential objections. He still says, \"I didn't set out to be an integrationist.\"\n\nHolmes later said of the first day: \"There were no catcalls, no racial slurs,\u2026 It was quiet and serene. Nothing happened; there was just curiosity and disbelief.\" He learned that the white students would refuse to sit at the same table with him in the library and student cafeteria, so suffered from isolation. He encountered occasional heckling, but said that it did not seem to be personal. \"Some befriended me and treated me with dignity and respect. Many just ignored me.\""}, {"source": "bitagent.source.8670813420644463910866405569288719372", "context": "After a successful summer semester and few problems, Holmes was personally encouraged by the Colvard administration to return for the fall semester, which he did. Also, Dr. Conner and other black members of the university and Starkville community asked Holmes to stay, saying his presence was critical to a potential black student considering enrollment. Dr. Dean W. Colvard and the faculty were supportive. The student body, overall, treated Holmes well.\n\nThe university arranged for Holmes to have a twin-bed room in the new and (comparatively) luxurious Evans Hall residence facility, normally reserved for graduate students. His greatest struggle was with the isolation enforced by white students. Most of his friends from Starkville were attending college somewhere else. Students at MSU were reluctant to have an open friendship with him because of the lingering pressure of Mississippi \"closed society\" norms. He missed the extracurricular activities which he had been involved in at Wiley. There he had been active in Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity and the football program. He sometimes wished he could have continued that.\n\nMany students were likely unaware of the landmark occasion. In the fall, a Mexican-American transfer student from Tucson, Arizona arrived at the campus Baptist Student Union for a Thanksgiving service. She said to the minister that she had seen another Mexican on campus whom she might invite to the BSU and described Holmes. \"Oh no!\" he [the minister] replied, \"that's the Negro student who's integrating us. But, I think he's Methodist.\"\n\nFor the next two years, Holmes worked diligently toward a bachelor's degree in liberal arts. Needing an income, Holmes left full-time student status in 1967 to teach school nearby in Alabama. Continuing on part-time status with night and correspondence courses, he graduated with a B.A. in 1969."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.187831147240614478653568838469224862241", "context": "Holmes enlisted in the US Army and served two years.

The use of complex patterns, naturalistic figures, and elaborate detailing in these works had a profound impact on artists in continental Europe, who began to incorporate similar elements into their own art during the Romanesque and Gothic periods.\n\nSecondly, Insular art played a key role in the development of the Insular script, a form of script that combined elements of Latin with older Celtic scripts. This script was used in illuminated manuscripts, such as the Book of Kells, and was an important precursor to the Gothic script, which became widespread in continental Europe during the Gothic period.\n\nFinally, the High Crosses found in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, which are a hallmark of Insular art, show a strong influence from Romanesque and Gothic art on the continent.

After the formation of a PYD/YPG-aligned FSA group, named the Kurdish Front, at the end of 2012 and the beginning of 2013, the influence of other Kurdish FSA groups such as the Azad\u00ee Battalion and the Saladin Ayubi Brigade began to decline."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.186823478065801085115996606938891510209", "context": "Meanwhile, Cumma's Kurdish Freedom Party left the Kurdish Supreme Committee, an attempted coalition government of pro- and anti-PYD parties for the Syrian Kurdish-held territories, in February 2013.

Sporadic fighting between the two groups continued, and Azad\u00ee Battalion fighters reportedly took part in attacks on the YPG-held Sheikh Maqsood neighborhood of Aleppo since September 2013. The group also fought with other rebels against the Syrian Army in Aleppo's Khan al-Asal and Rashidin.\n\nWhen the al-Nusra Front and allied FSA units attacked and overran the Kurdish Front's positions at Tall Hasil and Tall Aran southeast of Aleppo International Airport, the Azad\u00ee Battalion was accused of having taken part in the fighting. The battalion itself denied this, while a FSA member declared that the Azad\u00ee Battalion had simply started policing the villages after their capture by the FSA. Nevertheless, the Kurdish Supreme Committee consequently started an investigation of the Azad\u00ee Battalion \"for allegedly taking part in the attacks against West Kurdistan\".

He also said that the YPG helped to break the Siege of Nubl and al-Zahraa, and that the PYD's rule over Afrin was a brutal, mismanaged dictatorship. Though the Azad\u00ee Battalion continued to fight against the YPG, its power reportedly dwindled over time, and pro-PYD media claimed that parts of the militia under Mahmut Hamo eventually split off and joined the Sultan Murad Division. The rest of the Azad\u00ee Battalion eventually joined the Elite Army while remaining under Azad Shabo's command. The unit thereafter came to call itself the \"Elite Battalion\", though also continued to use its old name. It is unclear how numerous the unit still is; Shabo said in late January 2018 that there were \"dozens\" of Kurds fighting with pro-Turkish forces in Syria, though claimed a few weeks later that his unit included \"100 Kurdish fighters affiliated with the FSA\".\n\nOperations with the SNA \nThe Azad\u00ee Battalion became part of the Syrian National Army in 2016 and took part in Operation Euphrates Shield against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

Ltd., a commercial organisation that initially focused on nutrition, veterinary, and biochemical research. The original facilities were split over two locations; the main offices were within Cromwell House in the town of Huntingdon, Cambs, UK; and the main laboratories were at the Hartford Field Station (just over a mile away). It then became involved with pharmaceuticals, food additives, and industrial and consumer chemicals. In 1959 it changed its name to Nutritional Research Unit Ltd.

In that year it established Huntingdon Analytical Services Inc. to conduct business in the United States.\n\nTo augment its CRO business, Huntingdon acquired Minnesota's Twin City Testing Laboratory Inc. and affiliated companies in 1985, followed by the acquisition of Nebraska Testing Corporation in 1986; Travis Laboratories and Kansas City Test Laboratory Inc. in 1989; and Southwestern Laboratories, Inc. in 1990. Huntingdon also diversified its operations, primarily in the United States, becoming involved in engineering and environmental services.\n\nIn 1987, HLS purchased Northern Engineering and Testing, Inc., and then in 1988 bought Empire Soils Investigations Inc., Chen Associates Inc., and Asteco Inc. In 1988 HLS was floated on the London Stock Exchange and in 1989 obtained a listing on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1990 Huntingdon acquired the St. Louis branch of Envirodyne Engineers Inc. and Whiteley Holdings Ltd. And in 1991 it acquired Austin Research Engineers, Inc., followed by Travers Morgan Ltd.\n\nBy the early 1990s, Huntingdon was organised into three business groups: the Life Sciences Group, the Engineering/Environmental Group, and the Travers Morgan Group, which offered engineering and environmental consulting services outside of the United States. However, only the Life Sciences Group showed long-term promise. Travers Morgan was allowed to lapse into insolvency, control passed into other hands, and Huntingdon wrote off the investment.

The most recent numbers released state that in the UK around 60,000 animals are used annually. This number is broken down by species:\n\nControversy\nHuntingdon is criticised by animal rights and animal welfare groups for using animals in research, for instances of animal abuse and for the wide range of substances it tests on animals, particularly non-medical products. It is claimed by SHAC that 500 animals died every day at HLS (182,500 a year), a figure at odds with HLS' published numbers.\n\nHuntingdon's labs were infiltrated by undercover animal rights activists in 1997 in the UK and in 1998 in the US.\n\nIn 1997, film secretly recorded inside HLS in the UK by BUAV and subsequently broadcast on Channel 4 television as \"It's a Dog's Life\", showed serious breaches of animal-protection laws, including a beagle puppy being held up by the scruff of the neck and repeatedly punched in the face, and animals being taunted.\n\nThe laboratory technicians responsible were suspended from HLS the day after the broadcast. All three were later dismissed. Two of the men seen hitting and shaking dogs were found guilty under the Protection of Animals Act 1911 of \"cruelly terrifying dogs.\" It was the first time laboratory technicians had been prosecuted for animal cruelty in the UK.

According to PETA some of the film she shot showed a monkey being dissected while still alive and conscious. The president of HLS in New Jersey, Alan Staple, said the monkey was alive but sedated during the dissection.\n\nHLS obtained a \"gagging order\" in the US that prevents PETA from publicising or talking about any of the information that they discovered. The order also prevented PETA from communicating with the American Department of Agriculture, which had been going to investigate the evidence.\n\nProtests and intimidation\nThe Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (SHAC) campaign is based in the UK and US, and has aimed to close the company down since 1999. According to its website, the campaign's methods are restricted to non-violent direct action, as well as lobbying and demonstrations. It targets not only HLS itself, but any company, institution, or person allegedly doing business with the laboratory, whether as clients, suppliers, or even disposal and cleaning services, and the employees of those companies.\n\nDespite its stated non-violent position, SHAC members have been convicted of crimes of violence against HLS employees. On 25 October 2010 five SHAC members received prison sentences for threatening HLS staff. SHAC has also been accused of encouraging arson and violent assault. An HLS director was assaulted in front of his child. HLS managing director Brian Cass was sent a mousetrap primed with razor blades, and in February 2001 was attacked by three men armed with pickaxe handles and CS gas.

In total, 32 people linked to the group were arrested, and seven leading members of SHAC, including Greg Avery, were found guilty of blackmail. Police estimated in 2007 that, as a consequence of the operation, \"up to three quarters of the most violent activists\" were jailed.

In 1978, he was arrested and served a year in prison. In 1980, DeFriest retrieved work tools that his recently deceased father had willed him before the will had completed probate. His stepmother reported this to the police and he was charged with theft. Upon his arrest, DeFriest was found to have violated probation by possessing firearms and was sentenced to four years in prison. The original four-year sentence has developed into 34 years for 13 escape attempts, seven of which were successful, and hundreds of disciplinary reports for minor infractions. He was further charged with armed robbery for using a gun to steal a car during an attempted escape.\n\nDeFriest has cumulatively spent 27 years in solitary confinement. Following publicity, DeFriest was granted parole and released on 5 February 2019. Ten days later, he was rearrested as he checked into a mental health facility.\n\nEarly life \nDeFriest grew up in rural Gadsden County, Tallahassee, Florida, where he worked with his father. He was a known savant who could not quite understand people, but was able to build or fix just about anything. At six years old, he was disassembling and reassembling watches and engines. He often devised and conducted elaborate science experiments in his family's basement, saying he blew himself up a few times. While his mechanical knowledge was rapidly increasing, his psychological well being continued to worsen.\n\nDeFriest was close with his father, who encouraged his mechanical abilities, and the two had what filmmaker Gabriel London called \"a mechanical connection.\" His father had served in World War II with the OSS, a predecessor to the CIA. This experience likely prompted Mark's father to teach his son the avoidance tactics, survival, and defense techniques that Mark describes as guerilla warfare. DeFriest's father died suddenly in 1979. In his will, the elder DeFriest left his tools to his son, Mark."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.212916797590396636448787100905002581635", "context": "Initial arrest \nDeFriest, who was struggling with mental health issues at the time, collected the tools. Unfortunately for him, the will had not completed probate, which meant that, in the eyes of the law, the tools had been stolen. DeFriest's stepmother called the police and he was arrested. When the police came for DeFriest, he ran from them out of panic. He took a gun with him, but never used it or even brandished it before the officers. For the alleged theft, DeFriest was sentenced to four years in prison. Subsequent escapes led to a life sentence as well as years of emotional and physical abuse within the prison system.\n\nMental state and legal competence \nDeFriest's has always behaved erratically. Highly intelligent and lacking in social skills, he stood out in prison. This outsider mentality may have fueled his decision to attempt escape from every facility that would ever house him.\n\nFive out of six psychiatrists deemed DeFriest incompetent and mentally ill. At the time, the dissenting psychiatrist, Dr. Robert Berland, believed DeFriest's behavior (which included assumption of false identities as well as his compulsive escape attempts) was intentional. Based on Berland's assessment, the court allowed DeFriest to stand trial and he accepted a life sentence. Berland reversed his assessment decades later.\n\nToday, professionals think DeFriest's behavioral problems are likely associated with autism spectrum disorder, which may impair the development of social skills and cause an inability to judge the emotions of others."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.81442070434261287474986167301401187045", "context": "Prison escapes \nDeFriest made his first escape after a month at Florida State Hospital in Chattahoochee. He put LSD-25 from the hospital's pharmacy into the staff's coffee, in a plan to slip out while the staff was under the drug's influence. The plan fell apart when security arrived and the ward was locked down. During his first escape, he and a few other prisoners attempted to scale the facility's boundary wall. DeFriest got over the fence, hot-wired a car, and made a successful escape, which only lasted until he was recaptured and sent to Bay County Jail. Altogether, DeFriest has attempted 13 escapes. He could replicate keys after memorizing their patterns, and make them out of anything available. He fashioned a zip gun out of a toothpaste tube. DeFriest infuriated prison guards with his cleverness, which saw him execute 13 escape attempts, 7 of which were successful. During one of these escapes, Defriest stole a car using a gun, for which he would later be charged with armed robbery. His \"escape artist\" reputation led to almost 40 years in harsh prison conditions.\n\nTreatment in prison \nDeFriest was tormented by both guards and inmates because of his unique nature. 27 of the 31 years he has spent incarcerated have seen him subjected to solitary confinement.\n\nIn 1982 he was transferred to Florida State Prison (FSP). Ron McAndrew, FSP's warden from 1996 to 1998, described the northern Florida prison as \"ungovernable\"  due to situations including beating and degrading of inmates by officers who would also incite violence between inmates. He said correctional officers despised DeFriest and that they were intimidated by his intellect.

The reports are for possessing contraband. He\u2019s made his own alcohol. He\u2019s had weapons, usually defensive. He has not hurt people.\" She was correct, in that none of the charges against DeFriest involved violence.\n\nIn 1999, DeFriest witnessed the fatal beating of Frank Valdes who had been convicted of murdering a correctional officer. DeFriest was a few cells away and confirmed the medical examiner's conclusion that Valdes was beaten to death.

This would have made a possible release date of March 2015, but additional outstanding sentences for cocaine, marijuana, contraband possession, and armed robbery were not first considered.\n\nDeFriest was finally granted parole on February 5th, 2019, with one of the conditions being that he spend 12 months in a mental health and substance abuse treatment facility. Community Outreach, Inc. in Corvallis, Oregon was agreed upon due to its proximity to Bonnie's (his wife) home. DeFriest entered the facility on February 7th, 2019.\n\nBy February 13, Community Outreach revoked DeFriest\u2019s residence due to unspecified behavioral violations.  This raised the question of whether the Oregon facility was appropriately informed, prepared or capable of providing DeFriest with the treatment, structure, and care he needed for a successful transition into public life, as did the revelation that DeFriest tested positive for methamphetamine at the facility.

These stories are describing Jewish success in the Diaspora, where it was important to emphasize Jewish wisdom and statecraft during periods of foreign domination in order to strengthen the sense of worth and ethnic pride of the Jewish people.\n\nAncestry\nAccording to rabbinical tradition Daniel was of royal descent; and his fate, together with that of his three friends, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, was foretold by the prophet Isaiah to King Hezekiah in these words, \"and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon\".\n\nAccording to this view, Daniel and his friends were eunuchs, and were consequently able to prove the groundlessness of charges of immorality brought against them, which had almost caused their death at the hands of the king. It was said of Daniel, \"If he were in one scale of the balance and all the wise men of the heathens in the other, he would outweigh them all\".\n\nNebuchadnezzar admired Daniel greatly, although Daniel refused the proffered divine honors, thus distinguishing himself favorably from the contemporary ruler of Tyre, who demanded honor as a god.\n\nDaniel and Nebuchadnezzar\nThe rabbis had difficulty reconciling Daniel's concern and apparent friendliness towards the man who had destroyed the Temple. They handled this in two ways. When Daniel explains to Nebuchadnezzar the dream of the tree that was cut down, the rabbis viewed it in the context of Isaiah 56:1, which is sometimes rendered \"Do what is right, and give alms.\"  The midrash explains that Daniel advised him to atone for his sins by good deeds, and for his misdeeds by kindness to the poor. This was because Daniel knew that many of the Jewish exiles were starving."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.98303750625912156381976005725218915920", "context": "When Daniel says, \"My lord, this dream should be for your enemies, and its meaning for your foes,\" the rabbis conclude that this is addressed to God, rather than king Nebuchadnezzar; otherwise it could be interpreted as favoring Nebuchadnezzar over Israel.\n\nAngels\nNo names of angels are mentioned in the Bible until the Book of Daniel, where Michael and Gabriel make their appearance. This led the Rabbis to assert that the names of the angels were something that the returning exiles brought with them from Babylonia. Gabriel was believed to have been the angel who delivered Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah from the fiery furnace.\n\nNebuchadnezzar's idol\n\nDaniel denied himself much in the matter of food, since he would not partake of the wine and oil of the heathens. Daniel was not forced, as were his three friends, to worship the idol which Nebuchadnezzar set up; for the king, who well knew that Daniel would rather be cast into the fiery furnace than commit idolatry, sent him away from Babylon so he would not be forced to condemn him. Furthermore, it was God's intention to cause the three men to be taken out of the furnace during the absence of Daniel, so that their rescue should not be ascribed to the merit of the latter."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.111408949629294684397478332598757269541", "context": "Nevertheless, the king endeavored to induce Daniel to worship the idol, by trying to make him believe that it was alive and real. He ordered that there be placed in its mouth the frontlet (tzitz) of the high priest, on which was written the name of God; and since this name possessed the miraculous power of enabling inanimate things to speak, the idol could utter the words \"I am thy god.\" Daniel, however, was not to be so easily deceived. Asking permission to kiss the idol on the mouth, he stepped before it and conjured the frontlet in the following words: \"Although I am only a man of flesh and blood, yet I stand here as God's messenger. Take care that God's name is not desecrated by you, and thus I command you to follow me.\" While he was kissing the idol, the frontlet passed from the idol's mouth into his. When Nebuchadnezzar, as usual, sent for musicians to give songs of praise to the idol, he noticed that Daniel had silenced it.\n\nIn the lions' den\n\nDaniel's success at court naturally excited the envy and ill will of the Babylonians, who gathered in a mob and threatened the king and his house if he did not deliver Daniel to them. The king was powerless to resist, and the people took Daniel and threw him into a den with seven famished lions. Daniel remained there unharmed for six days, being fed during that time by the prophet Habakkuk, whom an angel had in an instant transported from Judea to Babylon, holding him by the hair of his head. On the seventh day the king went to the den to bewail Daniel, and was astonished to find him alive."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.122493755583126360942557934110232304628", "context": "Although Daniel was not forced to sin in any way, he was prepared to sacrifice his life rather than omit his prayers; hence it was easy for his enemies to convict him of having violated the royal order. While he was at prayer his enemies entered his room, and watched to see whether the accusations against him could be substantiated, as the king did not believe them. Daniel did not omit his Mincha prayer. Despite his friendship for Daniel, the king listened to the nobles' accusations, and condemned Daniel to be cast into the den of lions. The mouth of the den was closed with a huge stone, which had rolled on its own from Palestine to Babylon for that purpose. Upon this stone sat an angel in the shape of a lion, so that Daniel's enemies might not harass him.\n\nDaniel's enemies insisted that the lions were tame because they were not hungry, whereupon the king commanded that the accusers themselves spend a night with the beasts. As a result, the enemies of Daniel, numbering 122, with their wives and children, making a total of 366 persons, were torn by 1,469 lions.\n\nAlthough Daniel was no prophet in the rabbis' opinion, God held him worthy to receive the revelation of the destiny of Israel, even to the Day of Judgment, thus distinguishing him from his friends, the prophets Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, who had no visions. Daniel, however, forgot the \"end\" revealed to him, after an angel had shown him everything.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n Henze, M.

In the same year, brewer Gerard Adriaan Heineken was denied permission to open a bar in the park, so he built the Bierhuis Vondel (English: \"Beer House Vondel\") in a nearby street in what is now Vondelstraat 41.\n\nThe last part of the park was designed by Louis Paul Zocher, Jan David Zocher's son, and was realized from 1875 to 1877.

It was only after mediation of the Algemene Nederlandsche Wielrijders-Bond (English: \"General Dutch Cyclists Union\"), that helped fund the park, that a park guard was installed and cyclists were again permitted to cycle normally.\n\n20th century\n\nIn 1936, a rose garden was created in the center of the park."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.303323063288471209565068360541440534572", "context": "One year later in 1937, the Blauwe Theehuis (English: \"Blue Tearoom\") was opened.

Every year parts of South Asia are hit by a period of heavy rains known monsoons which usually fall between June and September. It is caused by a change of wind patterns over the region. This change causes heavy rains in the summer and long dry spells over the other months. In India, the monsoon rains can provide 70% of the country's rainfall for the year. The rain fall so quickly and heavily that it can cause sudden flooding. The rationale for the anomalous rainfall in 2018 might have recurred the extreme events in 2019; i.e., the High-Frequency Mixed Rossby-Gravity Waves in the Mid-Troposphere which were triggered by the synoptic disturbances of the tropical Pacific.  These high-frequency waves manifested as cyclonic and anticyclonic circulations and dilated the wind field to establish zones of convection in the tropics, as they propagated across the Indian Ocean basin. Although the Madden-Julian Oscillation phase with 20\u201340 days period has favored convection in the tropics, the high-frequency mode correlates better with the anomalous precipitation during the intervals of extreme events."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.321418400000669278826782359227873931979", "context": "Unrestricted mining operations in places have contributed to environmental degradation.

The description was based on a specimen that Pierre Sonnerat, a French naturalist and explorer, had collected during his 1770 visit of Madagascar, on the eastern coast, possibly near Fort Dauphin. In 1789, Johann Friedrich Gmelin, a naturalist from Germany, gave the name Loxia pensilis, based on a description by English ornithologist John Latham, who himself had not provided a binomial name. In 1827, George Shaw, an English zoologist and botanist, included L. pensilis in the genus Ploceus. In 1850, Charles Lucien Bonaparte assigned the species to his newly erected genus Nelicurvius. No subspecies have been described. The original genus name Parvus is Latin and means \"little\". It is presumed that the species epithet nelicourvi was derived from the Tamil word \"nellukuruvi\", a name for a waxbill or finch on Sri Lanka. In 1783, John Latham gave the species its first common name in English, calling it \"pensile grosbeak\". \"Nelicourvi weaver\" has been designated the official name by the International Ornithological Committee (IOC). Vernacular names in Malagasi are  fodisaina, fodifetsy and farifotramavo.\n\nBased on recent DNA-analysis, the genus Ploceus is almost certainly polyphyletic. If all species currently included in the genus would remain and the genus would be made monophyletic, it would have to encompass the entire subfamily Ploceinae. The Ploceinae can be divided into two groups. In the first group, the widowbirds and bishops (genus Euplectes) are sister to a clade in which the genera Foudia and Quelea are closest relatives and which further includes the Asiatic species of Ploceus, i.e. P. manyar, P. philippinus, P. benghalensis, P. megarhynchus, (and P. hypoxanthus, although untested). Since Georges Cuvier picked P. philippinus as the type species, these five species would logically remain assigned to the genus Ploceus."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.297679639918742071868458172997244048845", "context": "Basic to the second group is a clade consisting of both species sofar included in Ploceus that live on Madagascar, P. nelicourvi and P. sakalava, and these are morphologically very distinct from the remaining species.

This second group further contains the genera Malimbus and Anaplectes, and all remaining Ploceus species.\n\nDescription \nThe nelicourvi weaver is a slender sparrow-like bird of  long and weighing . During the breeding period, the male has a black beak, (reddish) brown eyes and blackish to brownish grey legs. His head is black, including the cheeks, around the ears, the forehead, crown and nape.

The lower chest and belly are bluish-grey, the lower flanks grey with a greenish hue. The wing flight feathers are blackish, with those near the wing tips with narrow greenish yellow edges and those more to the base with broad olive-green edges. The alula and primary coverts are blackish, while all other coverts are bright olive green. The underside of the wing consists of light grey feathers with a yellowish tinge. The shoulders, and upper tailbase are also bright olive-green, the under tailbase chestnut-colored, while the tail flight feathers are blackish with wide olive-green.

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 64, based on 5 reviews. David Jeffries of AllMusic gave the album four out of five stars, saying \"Good news for fans who stuck it out this long is that I Am is the moment when the skies clear, as the album comes on strong with a hard-hitting set of openers, and then, the high quality is maintained with a set of easy-flowing supportive songs that broaden the LP spectrum, all without leaving Gotti's comfort zone.\" Ronald Grant of HipHopDX gave the album two and a half stars out of five, saying \"At the end of the day, I Am\u2019s overall passable production and flashes of potency and strength keep it afloat for a time. And Gotti deserves commendation for his talent at bringing an explicit rawness, reality and affection to his autobiographical bars. But even those considerations aren\u2019t enough to make this album worth more than a few listens, sadly relying on a continuous set of monotonous hooks and overly used trap beats that saturate a strong majority of current popular Rap music.\" Reed Jackson of XXL gave the album an L, saying \"On the majority of I Am, he stays rooted in the ideas and melodies that he\u2019s been refining since he first dropped From Da Dope Game 2 Da Rap Game over 10 year ago. The self-proclaimed \u201cKing Of Memphis\u201d has lived up to his title again, and perhaps this album will help him continue his reign for another 10 years.\""}, {"source": "bitagent.source.63567217782509708125332883010071898328", "context": "Paul Cantor of Vibe gave the album a positive review, saying \"If there\u2019s one glaring downside to I Am, it\u2019s that a handful of songs sound, well, a lot like other songs. [...] One on the one hand you applaud Gotti for implementing a hit-making formula so effectively, and after all, songs sounding like other songs is not an uncommon thing. But on the other hand, why couldn't Gotti couldn't come up with his own blueprint for smash records? Maybe after all these years he didn't want to leave too much up to chance. Not sure we can be mad at that.\" Grant Jones of RapReviews gave the album a 4.5 out of 10, saying \"If you can get past the ignorance, this is enjoyable for what it is - an album to be played loudly in your car, with the windows down and a middle finger up to anybody who looks at you disapprovingly.\" Louis Goggans of the Memphis Flyer gave the album a positive review, saying \"Gotti\u2019s transition from dominating the underground rap circuit to enjoying mainstream success with hits like \u201c5 Star\u201d and \u201cMen Lie, Women Lie\u201d convey that hard work pays off. And he continues to utilize the very same work ethic that's brought him to this point in his career on his latest project. Although Gotti doesn't sway too far from his usual topics on the album, he doesn't display any signs of decline creatively either. After more than 10 years in the game, Gotti still has the ability to provide listeners with quality music and this is evident with I Am.\"\n\nAwards and nominations"}, {"source": "bitagent.source.135661390635484641816147995021721734550", "context": "Commercial performance\nI Am debuted at number seven on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 48,000 copies in its first week, becoming Yo Gotti's first US top ten debut.

Thus it is impossible to establish whether Rykener's encounters were brief, or part of longer-term relationships. The majority, suggests Karras, were the former. Karras and Boyd point out the difficulties in viewing Rykener today as Rykener would have viewed himself. \"In modern terms\", they wrote in 1996, Rykener \"would be described as a transvestite (because he cross-dressed) and a prostitute (because he took money for sex), and probably a bisexual\" although this label is somewhat \"problematic\", they suggest, as scholars have no means of assessing what it would have meant to Rykener.\n\nScholarship and influence"}, {"source": "bitagent.source.208934775936664566287291540177271292093", "context": "Historian James A. Schulz has suggested that Rykener's story is of more importance to historians than, for example, that of Tristan and Isolde. While their story illustrates little of the true nature of courtly love\u2014being a paradigm and mythical rather than reality\u2014Rykener's case tells much about the \"marginal, transgressive\" world of medieval sexuality. Rykener's responses to interrogation have been described as one of the very few glimpses the modern era has into medieval sexual identities. Another scholar has described the Rykener case as, with its \"tangled language and arresting mix of frankness and ambiguity\u00a0... remain[ing] a mainstay of medieval, queer and gender studies ever since\" Karras's discovery. Normington has described the case as an example of a medieval court \"grappling with gender distinctions\". Karras has argued that Rykener is a medieval example of a transgender person, rather than merely a transvestite or cross-dresser. Karras says that \"even if we do not know anything about Rykener's"}, {"source": "bitagent.source.145729883037847771513865316344784815874", "context": "self-identification, her life as a male-bodied woman was 'transgender-like'.\" Karras notes that nothing is known of Rykener's (or anybody else's) feelings in this case, and since the interrogation was recorded in Latin (which Rykener may not have known), historians may not have an accurate record of what was really said. The only time Rykener ever seems to have offered a personal opinion on these events was when Rykener opined to preferring priests: but this was \"only because they paid more\". Carolyn Dinshaw suggests that Rykener's living and working in Oxford as a woman for a time indicates that Rykener enjoyed doing so. Likewise, Cordelia Beattie considers that Rykener's ability to pass as a woman \"in everyday life would have involved other gendered behaviour\". She considers that to modern historians and sociologists, the Rykener case is part of a \"long-standing tradition\" within the study of gender.

Goldberg considers that the mayor and aldermen were most concerned with Rykener as a trader, and as a false one at that: \"a tradesperson who purports to be an embroideress and a barmaid, but actually sells sex.\u00a0... Even as a prostitute he is a dishonest trader: he poses as a woman selling straight sex to male clients, whereas he is, in fact, a man masquerading as a woman.\" Goldberg suggests that historians may have misread the true significance of the original document.

If the mayor and aldermen are concerned with Rykener's honesty (or not), says Goldberg, then it is \"here a specifically bourgeois concern that grows out of the needs of trade\". Judith Bennett has suggested that Rykener, through choice of work, had \"taken a women's passive position in society\", and that it was this\u2014rather than the actual offences of prostitution and sodomy\u2014that \"most transfixed\" Rykener's interrogators.

The eagle's wings were torn off in an Atlantic storm during the 1914 season, after which the figurehead was removed and replaced with gold scroll-work similar to that on the stern.\n\nDuring her initial sea trials, the ship ran aground on the Elbe river due to insufficient dredging and a flash fire in the engine room which resulted in eight crewmen being taken to hospital. During her official trials, she suffered overheating of the turbines and some stability issues were discovered. The trials were therefore abandoned and the builders were called in to carry out emergency work.

She was sold to Sir John Jarvis, who had also purchased Olympic, to provide work for unemployed shipbuilders in Jarrow, County Durham.

It is a member of the family Phocidae (true seals). Elephant seals derive their name from their great size and from the male's large proboscis, which is used in making extraordinarily loud roaring noises, especially during the mating competition. Sexual dimorphism in size is great. Correspondingly, the mating system is highly polygynous; a successful male is able to impregnate up to 50 females in one season.\n\nDescription\n\nThe huge male northern elephant seal typically weighs  and measures , although some males can weigh up to . Females are much smaller and can range from  in weight, or roughly a third of the male's bulk, and measure from . The bull southern elephant seals are, on average, larger than those in the northern species, but the females in both are around the same size, indicating the even higher level of sexual dimorphism in the southern species. Northern elephant seals typically live for around 9 years.\nBoth adult and juvenile elephant seals are bar-skinned and black before molting. After molting, they generally have a silver to dark gray coat that fades to brownish-yellow and tan. Adult males have hairless necks and chests speckled with pink, white, and light brown. Pups are mostly black at birth and molt to a silver gray after weaning."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.278276583993249598372125530278367882067", "context": "The eyes are large, round, and black. The width of the eyes and a high concentration of low-light pigments suggest sight plays an important role in the capture of prey. Like all seals, elephant seals have atrophied hind limbs whose underdeveloped ends form the tail and tail fin. Each of the \"feet\" can deploy five long, webbed fingers. This agile, dual palm is used to propel water. The pectoral fins are used little while swimming.\nWhile their hind limbs are unfit for locomotion on land, elephant seals use their fins as support to propel their bodies. They are able to propel themselves quickly (as fast as 8\u00a0km/h) in this way for short-distance travel, to return to water, catch up with a female or chase an intruder.\n\nLike other seals, elephant seals' bloodstreams are adapted to the cold in which a mixture of small veins surrounds arteries capturing heat from them. This structure is present in extremities such as the hindlimbs.\n\nA unique characteristic of the northern elephant seal is that it has developed the ability to store oxygenated red blood cells within its spleen. In a 2004 study researchers used MRI to observe physiological changes of the spleens of 5 seal pups during simulated dives. By 3 minutes, the spleens on average contracted to a fifth of their original size, indicating a dive-related sympathetic contraction of the spleen. Also, a delay was observed between contraction of the spleen and increased hematocrit within the circulating blood, and attributed to the hepatic sinus. This fluid-filled structure is initially expanded due to the rush of RBC from the spleen and slowly releases the red blood cells into the circulatory system via a muscular vena caval sphincter found on the cranial aspect of the diaphragm. This ability to slowly introduce RBC into the blood stream is likely to prevent any harmful effects caused by a rapid increase in hematocrit."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.4021542941643039945617581378925087089", "context": "Range and ecology\nThe northern elephant seal lives in the eastern Pacific Ocean. They spend most of their time at sea, and usually only come to land to give birth, breed, and molt.  These activities occur at rookeries that are located on offshore islands or remote mainland beaches.  The majority of these rookeries are in California and northern Baja California, ranging from Point Reyes National Seashore, California to Isla Natividad, Mexico. Significant breeding colonies exist at Channel Islands, A\u00f1o Nuevo State Reserve, Piedras Blancas Light, Morro Bay State Park and the Farallon Islands in the US, and Isla Guadalupe, Isla Benito del Este and Isla Cedros in Mexico. In recent decades the breeding range has extended northwards. In 1976 the first pup was found on Point Reyes and a breeding colony established there in 1981. Since the mid-1990s some breeding has been observed at Castle Rock in Northern California and Shell Island off Oregon, and in January 2009 the first elephant seal births were recorded in British Columbia at Race Rocks. The California breeding population is now demographically isolated from the population in Baja California.\n\nNorthern elephant seals exhibit extreme sexual dimorphism in their feeding behaviours.  When the males leave their rookeries, they migrate northwards to their feeding grounds along the continental shelf from Washington to the western Aleutians in Alaska. The males mostly feed on benthic organisms on the ocean floor. When the females leave their rookeries, they head north or west into open ocean, and forage across a large area in the northeastern Pacific. They have been recorded as far west as Hawaii. Female elephant seals feed mainly on pelagic organisms in the water column."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.46980129978064604778785132314851018393", "context": "Vagrant elephant seals possibly appear on tropical regions such as at Mariana Islands. Historical occurrences of elephant seal presence, residential or occasional, in western North Pacific are fairly unknown. There have been two records of vagrants visiting to Japanese coasts; a male on Niijima in 1989 and a young seal on beaches in Hasama, Tateyama in 2001. A 2.5 meter female was found on Sanze beach, Tsuruoka, Yamagata in October 2017, making it the first record from Sea of Japan. This individual was severely weakened but showing signs of recovery after receiving medications at Kamo Aquarium, and the aquarium is discussing whether or not to release her.\nSome individuals have been observed on the coast of northeast Asia. Certain individuals established haul-out sites at the Commander Islands in the early 2000s; however, due to aggressive interactions with local Steller sea lions, long-term colonization is not expected.\n\nFemale elephant seals forage in the open ocean, while male elephant seals forage along the continental shelf. Males usually dive straight down to the ocean floor and stay at the bottom foraging for benthic prey. The females hunt for pelagic prey in the open ocean, and dive deeper (up to 1735 m, though on average about 500 m) and stay down longer than the males. Northern elephant seals eat a variety of prey, including mesopelagic fish such as myctophids, deep-water squid, Pacific hake, pelagic crustaceans, relatively small sharks, rays, and ratfish. Octopoteuthis deletron squid are a common prey item, one study found this species in the stomachs of 58% of individuals sampled off the coast of California. A female northern elephant seal was documented in 2013 by a deep sea camera at a depth of , where it consumed a Pacific hagfish, slurping it up from the ocean floor. The event was reported by a Ukrainian boy named Kirill Dudko, who further reported the find to scientists in Canada.

Elephant seals do not have a developed a system of echolocation in the manner of cetaceans, but their vibrissae, which are sensitive to vibrations, are assumed to play a role in search of food. Males and females differ in diving behavior. Males tend to hug the continental shelf while making deep dives and forage along the bottom, while females have more jagged routes and forage in the open ocean. Elephant seals are prey for orcas and great white sharks. Both are most likely to hunt pups, and seldom hunt large bull elephant seals, but have taken seals of all ages. The shark, when hunting adults, is most likely to ambush a seal with a damaging bite and wait until it is weakened by blood loss to finish the kill.\n\nSocial behavior and reproduction\n\nNorthern elephant seals return to their terrestrial breeding ground in December and January, with the bulls arriving first. The bulls haul out on isolated or otherwise protected beaches, typically on islands or very remote mainland locations. It is important that these beach areas offer protection from the winter storms and high surf wave action. The bulls engage in fights of supremacy to determine which few bulls will achieve a harem."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.11944815013442728142889751964195525654", "context": "After the males have arrived to the beach, the females arrive to give birth. Females fast for five weeks and nurse their single pup for four weeks; in the last few days of lactation, females come into estrus and mate. In this polygynous society, a high-ranking bull can have a harem of 30\u2013100 cows, depending on his size and strength. Males unable to establish harems will wait on the periphery, and will try to mount nearby females. Dominant bulls will disrupt copulations of lower-ranking bulls. They can mount females without interference, but commonly break off to chase off rivals. While fights are not usually to the death, they are brutal and often with significant bloodshed and injury; however, in many cases of mismatched opponents, the younger, less capable males are simply chased away, often to upland dunes. In a lifetime, a successful bull could easily sire over 500 pups. Most copulations in a breeding colony are done by only a small number of males and the rest may never be able to mate with a female. Pups are sometimes crushed during battles between bulls."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.248219000777068709493512604306941558649", "context": "After arrival on shore, males fast for three months, and females fast for five weeks during mating and when nursing their pups. The gestation period is about 11 months. Sometimes, a female can become very aggressive after giving birth and will defend her pup from other females. Such aggression is more common in crowded beaches. While most females nurse their own pups and reject nursings from alien pups, some do accept alien pups with their own. An orphaned pup may try to find another female to suckle and some are adopted, at least on A\u00f1o Nuevo Island. Some pups, known as super weaners, may grow to exceptionally large sizes by nursing from other females in addition to their mothers. Pups nurse about four weeks and are weaned abruptly before being abandoned by their mother, who heads out to sea within a few days. Left alone, weaned pups will gather into groups and stay on shore for 12 more weeks. The pups learn how to swim in the surf and eventually swim farther to forage. Thus, their first long journey at sea begins.\n\nElephant seals communicate though various means. Males will threaten each other with the snort, a sound caused by expelling air though their probosces, and the clap-trap, a loud, clapping sound comparable to the sound of a diesel engine. Pups will vocalize when stressed or when prodding their mothers to allow them to suckle. Females make an unpulsed attraction call when responding to their young, and a harsh, pulsed call when threatened by other females, males or alien pups. Elephant seals produce low-frequency sounds, both substrate-borne and air-borne. These sounds help maintain social hierarchy in crowded or noisy environments and reduce energy consumption when fasting.\n\nHistory and status"}, {"source": "bitagent.source.2216470713404202510992924378217751600", "context": "Beginning in the 18th century, northern elephant seals were hunted extensively, almost to extinction by the end of the 19th century, being prized for oil made from their blubber, and the population may have fallen as low as only 20-40 individuals. In 1874, Charles Melville Scammon recorded in Marine Mammals of the Northwestern Coast of America, that an 18-ft-long bull caught on Santa Barbara Island yielded 210 gallons of oil. They were thought to be extinct in 1884 until a remnant population of eight individuals was discovered on Guadalupe Island in 1892 by a Smithsonian expedition, who promptly killed several for their collections. The elephant seals managed to survive, and were finally protected by the Mexican government in 1922. Since the early 20th century, they have been protected by law in both Mexico and in the United States. Subsequently, the U.S. protection was strengthened after passage of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, and numbers have now recovered to over 100,000.\n\nNevertheless, a genetic bottleneck experienced by Northern elephant seals during the nineteenth century made them more susceptible to disease, environmental changes and pollution. \nThis bottleneck caused a sharp loss of genetic diversity and increased homozygosity in the surviving population, and also a decreased number of haplogroups."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.247696561849254478044663913136176445944", "context": "In California, the population is continuing to grow at around 6% per year, and new colonies are being established; they are now probably limited mostly by the availability of haul-out space. Their breeding was probably restricted to islands, before large carnivores were exterminated or prevented from reaching the side of the ocean. Numbers can be adversely affected by El Ni\u00f1o events and the resultant weather conditions, and the 1997\u201398 El Ni\u00f1o may have caused the loss of about 80% of that year's pups. Presently, the northern elephant seal is protected under the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act and has a fully protected status under California law (California Fish and Game Code [FGC] \u00a7 4700).\n\nPopulations of rookery sites in California have increased during the past century. At A\u00f1o Nuevo State Park, for example, no individuals were observed whatsoever until 1955; the first pup born there was observed in the early 1960s. Currently, thousands of pups are born every year at A\u00f1o Nuevo, on both the island and mainland. The growth of the site near San Simeon has proved even more spectacular; no animals were there prior to 1990. Currently, the San Simeon site hosts more breeding animals than A\u00f1o Nuevo State Park during winter season.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nMarine Mammal Center \u2013 Northern elephant seal\nSCS: Northern elephant seal\nElephant Seal Research Group\nElephant seals \u2013 Earthguide\nVoices in the Sea - Sounds of the Northern elephant Seal\n\nMirounga\nPinnipeds of the Arctic Ocean\nMammals of Canada\nMammals described in 1866\nMammals of Mexico\nMammals of the United States\nMarine mammals\nWestern North American coastal fauna\nArticles containing video clips\nPinnipeds of North America"}], "correct_chunks": ["bitagent.source.278276583993249598372125530278367882067", "bitagent.source.4021542941643039945617581378925087089", "bitagent.source.46980129978064604778785132314851018393"], "write_answer": "The ability of the spleen in northern elephant seals to store oxygenated red blood cells is significant as it helps them in their extreme diving capabilities. As the spleen contracts during dives, it releases the stored red blood cells into the circulatory system at a controlled rate. This slow introduction of red blood cells into the bloodstream helps to prevent any harmful effects caused by a rapid increase in hematocrit (the ratio of red blood cells to the total volume of blood). The increased hematocrit aids in delivering oxygen to the vital organs during deep dives, which can last up to 2 hours and reach depths of over 1700 meters. This ability to store and release oxygenated blood cells allows elephant seals to forage for food in deep waters for extended periods with minimal risk to their health.", "answer": "In a 2004 study, researchers used MRI to observe physiological changes of the spleens of 5 seal pups during simulated dives. By 3 minutes, the spleens on average contracted to a fifth of their original size, indicating a dive-related sympathetic contraction of the spleen. Also, a delay was observed between contraction of the spleen and increased hematocrit within the circulating blood, and attributed to the hepatic sinus. This ability to slowly introduce RBC into the blood stream is likely to prevent any harmful effects caused by a rapid increase in hematocrit.", "citations": ["bitagent.source.46980129978064604778785132314851018393"], "process_time": 3.9827933311462402, "citation_rate": 0.3333333333333333, "relevent_content": true, "unique_response": null, "correct_response": true}, {"write_question": "What year was the George Ryga Award for Social Awareness in Literature established, and who were the key individuals involved in its creation?", "all_chunks": [{"source": "bitagent.source.190498324913748029210423454434065439395", "context": "The George Ryga Award for Social Awareness in Literature is a literary award given to a British Columbian author \"who has achieved an outstanding degree of social awareness in a new book published in the preceding calendar year.\" The prize was created in"}, {"source": "bitagent.source.204130154245963586763906541226719366274", "context": "2004 by Allan Twigg of BC Book World along with John Lent of Okanagan College and Ken Smedley, then working for the George Ryga Centre Society.

With his sidekick and ward, the sultry Sailor Duval (Bacall), tagging along, he encounters modern-day pirates and other tough situations while navigating the waters around Havana. Aboard his boat, the Bold Venture, Slate and Sailor experience \"adventure, intrigue, mystery and romance in the sultry settings of tropical Havana and the mysterious islands of the Caribbean.\"\n\nCalypso singer King Moses (Jester Hairston) provided musical bridges by threading plot situations into the lyrics of his songs. Music for the series was by David Rose.\n\nThe series combined elements of a number of past Bogart/Bacall film collaborations, most notably To Have and Have Not which also cast Bogart as a boat owner in the Caribbean who reluctantly becomes involved in intrigue while romancing Bacall. The relationship between Shannon and King Moses, and his ownership of an inn, is strongly reminiscent of the dynamic between Rick Blaine and Sam in Casablanca.\n\nProduction\n\nBeginning in March 1951, the Frederic W. Ziv Company syndicated 78 episodes via electrical transcription. Some sources have claimed that the 78 episodes include reruns, and that there were only around 30 episodes but more than 50 shows have now come to light.

The migration was due to a combination of jumps, asymmetric spreading, and segment propagation.  This model implies that the Queen Charlotte fault is lengthening to the south, while fragmenting the Explorer plate. Furthermore, this means that the Explorer plate is most likely being captured by the Pacific plate.  However, the previously subducted parts will remain in place, coupled with the North American Plate.  A similar process to this is taking place in the Rivera triple junction where small ephemeral plates were also formed.

Its plot follows the manager of an air freight company in a remote South American port town who is forced to risk his pilots' lives while vying for a major contract. It features supporting performances from Thomas Mitchell, Richard Barthelmess, Noah Beery Jr., and Rita Hayworth, marking the first major role for the last.\n\nReleased by Columbia Pictures in May 1939, the film is generally regarded as being among Hawks' finest films, particularly in its portrayal of the professionalism of the pilots of the film, its atmosphere, and the flying sequences.\n\nIn 2017, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\nPlot\nGeoff Carter is the head pilot and manager of Barranca Airways, a small, barely solvent company owned by \"Dutchy\" Van Ruyter carrying airmail from the fictional South American port town of Barranca through a high pass in the Andes Mountains. Bonnie Lee, a piano-playing entertainer, arrives on a banana boat one day. After making her acquaintance, Joe Souther crashes and dies trying to land in fog later that day.  Bonnie becomes infatuated with Geoff, despite his fatalistic attitude about the dangerous flying, and stays on in Barranca (not at his invitation, as he insists on telling her).\n\nThe situation is complicated by the arrival of pilot Bat MacPherson and his wife (and Geoff's old flame) Judy. McPherson cannot find work in the United States because he once bailed out of an airplane, leaving his mechanic\u2014the brother of \"Kid\" Dabb, Carter's best friend\u2014to die in the ensuing crash.

Geoff refuses, but then lets the Kid toss a coin to decide the matter. When it lands on the floor, Geoff discovers that the coin has two heads. Geoff still agrees to take him along. Just before leaving, Bonnie tries to talk Geoff out of going.  She takes his gun out of his holster and points it at him.  When she realizes that she cannot stop him, she drops the gun on the table, but it accidentally fires, hitting Geoff in the shoulder.\n\nUnable to fly, Geoff lets MacPherson take his place. However, MacPherson and the Kid are unable to climb high enough; the plane stalls and drops thousands of feet before leveling off. Geoff tells them to turn around, but they decide to try to fly through the fogged-in pass. In the pass, they encounter a flock of condors. One crashes through the windshield, paralyzing the Kid; another hits the No. 1 engine, setting it on fire. Later the No. 2 engine also catches fire. The Kid tells MacPherson to bail out, but he refuses. He turns around and returns to Barranca, managing to crash-land the burning Trimotor on the field. The Kid dies from a broken neck, but not before telling Geoff what MacPherson did.

Geoff leaves her with the coin. She then realizes that it is the Kid's trick coin, dispelling her sadness.\n\nCast\n\nProduction\n\nPre-production and casting\nThe film's original script outline was written by Anne Wigton; the working title originally was Plane No. 4. Howard Hawks re-wrote the film's scenario himself, based on a story that he wrote in 1938 titled Plane from Barranca. While he was scouting locations several years earlier, for the filming of Viva Villa!, Hawks had been especially inspired by the stoic aviation personnel that he had met in Mexico. The film's final script was written and re-written throughout the film's production, mostly by Hawks and Jules Furthman, but also with contributions by Eleanore Griffin and William Rankin.\n\nHawks had previously worked with Cary Grant the year before on Bringing up Baby and this was the second of five collaborations between the director and star.\n\nHe cast Jean Arthur in the leading role of Bonnie Lee after appraising her acting in several films directed by Frank Capra.\n\nHawks then hired silent film star Richard Barthelmess for the role of Bat MacPherson. Barthelmess's career had gradually diminished since sound films became popular in the late 1920s, and he was a controversial choice, mainly because he had recently had a botched plastic surgery operation on the skin under his eyes that resulted in permanent X-shaped scars under both of his eyes. Barthelmess usually wore heavy make-up to hide the scars, but Hawks wanted to use the scars for the character."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.219306712871155003737791852869302323240", "context": "Hawks had originally cast Dorothy Comingore in the role of Judy MacPherson, but studio head Harry Cohn had been grooming a young starlet that would be advanced for the role. With backing from Cohn, her agent then insisted that Hawks give Rita Hayworth a screen test, which eventually resulted in Hayworth being cast in the role.\n\nFilming\nShooting of Only Angels Have Wings began on December 19, 1938 at the Columbia Studio Ranch and Hawks shot the film in chronological sequence whenever possible. Hawks and Arthur initially found working together difficult and Arthur would often argue with Hawks on set. Hawks was attempting to coach Arthur to play a variation of the classical \"Hawksian Woman Archetype\", but Arthur often felt uncomfortable with his direction. Eventually, she unhappily agreed to play the role as he directed her. Years later after Arthur saw Lauren Bacall's performance in To Have and Have Not, Arthur apologized to Hawks and told him that she finally understood what he had wanted from her (epitomized in Bacall's repetition and emphasis on the paradoxical line \"I'm hard to get ... all you have to do is ask me.\") Hawks later said that he considered Arthur to have been good in the film.\n\nInitial shooting was completed on March 24, 1939, 31 days over its shooting schedule. This was followed with several weeks of second unit shooting of aircraft flying in various locations in the western United States. A few re-takes were shot in April with Cary Grant and Victor Kilian. Two days of re-shoots with Rita Hayworth were also shot, but were directed by Charles Vidor.\n\nIn a 1972 interview, Arthur revealed, \"I loved sinking my head into Cary Grant's chest\"."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.164522363074974943335431735934399516901", "context": "Aircraft used in the production\nThe \"cast\" also starred a 1929 Hamilton Metalplane, Ford Trimotor and TravelAir 6000 single engine monoplane. All of these types accurately represented the types of aircraft flying in the period depicted by the film. The Metalplane was the airplane Joe Souther crashes while trying to land in heavy fog, and was only used for ground shots. In 2007, one of the Hamilton props used in the simulated flying scenes for this aircraft surfaced on an episode of Antiques Roadshow; its owner had been able to screen match it, confirming its authenticity.  The Pilgrim was used in the exciting mine rescue flying scene, while the Ford Trimotor was featured in another dramatic landing that ends in a fiery crash.  Midway through the film, Paul Mantz flew a Boeing Model 100 biplane in a spirited aerobatic performance, reprising his earlier scene in Flight from Glory. Only Angels Have Wings has become very popular among enthusiasts of the aircraft of the golden age of aviation.\n\nRelease and reception\nTwelve days after the film's final re-shoots were completed, Only Angels Have Wings premiered in Los Angeles at the Pantages Theater on May 10, 1939. Its official world premiere occurred the next day at Radio City Music Hall. It was heavily promoted by Columbia Studios and ended up making $143,000 on its initial two-week run at radio City Music Hall, and earned over one million dollars overall. It was the third-highest-grossing film of 1939. The film was also Rita Hayworth's breakout role and helped make her a major Hollywood star, with Hayworth appearing on the cover of Look magazine after the film's success."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.208238997141538201221996209189175081820", "context": "Only Angels Have Wings received good reviews on its release, with Abel Green of Variety comparing it favorably to Flight From Glory and praised Barthelmess's performance. Frank S. Nugent in his review for The New York Times focused on the excitement found in the aerial scenes, also recognizing the talents of the star-studded cast, \"Mr. Hawks has staged his flying sequences brilliantly ... He has made proper use of the amiable performing talents of Mr. Grant, Miss Arthur, Thomas Mitchell, Mr. Barthelmess, Sig Rumann and the rest.\"\n\nOnly Angels have Wings was later selected as one of 12 films representing the U.S. at the first Cannes Film Festival. However, the festival was canceled in light of events leading up to World War II.\n\nOn Metacritic, the film holds a score of 86 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim.\"\n\nRadio adaptations\nTwo weeks after the film's premiere, Only Angels Have Wings was adapted as a one-hour radio play for the May 29, 1939 broadcast of Lux Radio Theatre. The film's principal actors, Cary Grant, Jean Arthur, Rita Hayworth, Richard Barthlemess and Thomas Mitchell all reprised their roles. Orson Welles headlined a radio adaptation on The Campbell Playhouse on February 25, 1940, that starred Welles and Joan Blondell.\n\nAwards and honors\nRoy Davidson and Edwin C. Hahn were nominated for the first-time Best Effects, Special Effects.\n\nLegacy\nOnly Angels Have Wings has become thought of as one of Hawks's best films, with Dave Kehr calling it the \"equilibrium point\" of Hawks's career, bridging themes developed in his early films of the 1930s to some of his darker films of the 1940s and 1950s. Film critics at Cahiers du Cinema also praised the film in the 1950s as a quintessential support of the auteur theory."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.19764848857771934810028657085230925969", "context": "See also\n List of misquotations: In one scene, Cary Grant calls after Hayworth's character by saying, \"Judy, Judy.\" This is the closest he ever came on film to the misquotation associated with him: \"Judy, Judy, Judy\".\n List of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, a film review aggregator website\n\nReferences\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\n\n \n \n \n \n \"Judy, Judy, Judy\" FAQ\n Only Angels Have Wings: Hawks\u2019s Genius Takes Flight an essay by Michael Sragow at the Criterion Collection\n\nStreaming audio\n Only Angels Have Wings on Lux Radio Theater: May 29, 1939\n Only Angels Have Wings on The Campbell Playhouse: February 25, 1940\n\n1939 films\n1939 drama films\nAmerican films\nAmerican drama films\nAmerican aviation films\nAmerican black-and-white films\n1930s English-language films\nFilms scored by Dimitri Tiomkin\nFilms directed by Howard Hawks\nFilms set in South America\nFilms adapted into radio programs\nFilms with screenplays by Jules Furthman\nFilms shot in Utah\nUnited States National Film Registry films\nFilms about postal systems\nColumbia Pictures films"}], "correct_chunks": ["bitagent.source.208238997141538201221996209189175081820"], "write_answer": "The metacritic score of Only Angels Have Wings is 86 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim.\" In the radio adaptations of this film, the actors who reprised their roles include Cary Grant, Jean Arthur, Rita Hayworth, Richard Barthelmess, and Thomas Mitchell for the Lux Radio Theatre adaptation, and Orson Welles and Joan Blondell for the Campbell Playhouse adaptation.", "answer": "On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 86 out of 100, indicating 'universal acclaim.'

Despite being haunted by a vision of her late husband Pierre, Amelia keeps up the brave front and the balloon successfully launches to a cheering crowd. In a flashback, James appears before the Royal Society and explains his theory that the weather can be predicted, but his fellow scientists mock him and refuse to finance his studies. Returning home, he talks to his parents, who try to persuade him to pursue another avenue of science. On the balloon, James and Amelia start rising through the cloud layer. They soon run into a violent storm which sends the balloon spinning. In a flashback, Amelia is persuaded by her sister Antonia to attend a society function.

James releases the first of five pigeons carrying messages stating the current altitude along with other scientific readings in case they don't survive.

In a flashback, as James practices for the flight, Amelia visits to tell him she has changed her mind. John goes to see Amelia that night to convince her, saying that she has an obligation to advance the cause of science. Amelia then goes to Pierre's grave to reflect. When it begins to snow (which John told her James had predicted), she decides to go with him after all. Eventually, the balloon exceeds , beating the record for the highest altitude. Amelia is shocked to learn that James didn't bring any clothes suitable for the rapidly decreasing temperature and decides to start descending. James refuses, and the two argue. Amelia agrees to keep rising, but makes it clear to James that they'll have to start descending soon.\n\nJames starts experiencing hypoxia from the altitude as they ascend, but insists they continue and tries to stop Amelia from descending. He relents only when Amelia tells him the story of how Pierre sacrificed himself to save her during a balloon flight. Amelia discovers the gas release valve on top of the balloon is frozen. As James falls unconscious, she has no choice but to climb up the outside of the balloon and open the valve from the top.

Formed in 1985, the group achieved international fame during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The original lineup consisted of Sa\u00fal Hern\u00e1ndez (vocals & guitar), Sabo Romo (bass guitar),  (drums), and Diego Herrera (keyboards and saxophone). Alejandro Marcovich later joined Caifanes as lead guitar player. Caifanes\u2019 style can be described as a hybrid of British new wave, progressive rock and Latin percussion underscored by deep, somber, and Latin American-Mexican-Spanish-influenced lyrics and the vocal style of Sa\u00fal Hern\u00e1ndez. Members of Caifanes have cited The Cure, The Beatles and King Crimson as major influences, with Adrian Belew having produced their third studio album, El Silencio, as well as making a guest appearance on it.\n\nThe name Caifanes is derived from 1940s Mexican pachuco (zoot suiter) slang \"Cae fine\". Its equivalent in English would be \u201ccool dude.\u201d The word has also been used to describe the proverbial Mexican pachuco, delinquent, or outsider.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly years\n\nThe seeds of what was to later become Caifanes were planted in 1984 with Las Insolitas Im\u00e1genes de Aurora (The Unusual Images of Aurora), a band that included Sa\u00fal Hern\u00e1ndez, Alfonso Andr\u00e9 and Alejandro Marcovich. According to Marcovich, Ins\u00f3litas started out as a side project for the purpose of performing as a party band for the filming of his brother's film project (Marcovich's brother went on to direct various videos for Caifanes). At the time, both Hern\u00e1ndez and Marcovich were playing in different bands. The members enjoyed the experience of playing in Insolitas and decided to continue. As the seriousness of the project grew the band began to play in different spots in Mexico City like Rockotitl\u00e1n, High Tower, and El Jabal\u00ed. In May 1986, Insolitas recorded a live demo performed at Rockotitl\u00e1n. Ins\u00f3litas developed a strong cult following in Mexico City."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.212810627101263881764911605951687708865", "context": "Ins\u00f3litas broke up in 1986. Sa\u00fal and Alfonso reformed as Caifanes with bass player/producer Sabo Romo and Diego Herrera on keyboards and sax. Caifanes\u2019 first live show was April 11, 1987, in Rockotitl\u00e1n. The building was filled to capacity and many people were left outside. Their popularity began to grow throughout Mexico City. By late 1987 Caifanes had carved a niche for themselves as a dark contrast to the corporate pop/rock and light ballads that dominated Mexican radio and television during the 1980s. At times the image and the sound were considered radical for the Mexican music industry. Between December 28, 1986 and January 3, 1987 Juan Aceves produced a four-song demo for the band using \"free\" studio time at night at Arco Studio (where Aceves was chief engineer). The demo was showcased on the independent radio program Espacio 59 (Space 59), a show that promoted up and coming rock bands. With demo in hand Caifanes approached CBS Mexico. The musical director at the time shunned them for dark new wave attire and said, \u201cYou look like fags.\u201d At the time, Caifanes\u2019 sound and look was influenced by British post-punk groups such as The Cure and The Jesus and Mary Chain. They dressed in black suits and sported frizzly hair and makeup. Upon hearing the demo of \u201cSer\u00e1 Por Eso\u201d (English: \"That's Why\"), the CBS executive said, \u201cAt CBS, our business is to sell records, not coffins.\u201d"}, {"source": "bitagent.source.92701317128770286305007937997878065281", "context": "Nevertheless, the movement of Rock en Espa\u00f1ol or rock en tu idioma (Rock in your language) was too strong to ignore by record execs. The flood of groups from Spain and Argentina forced Mexican labels to take a second look at up-and-coming Mexican bands. Caifanes received a big break when Ariola records invited them to open for Argentinean rocker Miguel Mateos\u2019 Mexico City show. The show brought Cafaines to the attention of Miguel Mateos\u2019 producer Oscar Lopez. Oscar fell in love with the band and took them to the studio to record a demo. Lopez would be instrumental in their signing to RCA-Ariola and would go on to produce their first two albums.\n\nCaifanes\u2019 debut album Caifanes (also known as M\u00e1tenme Porque Me Muero, Volumen I) was released in August 1988 by RCA-Ariola. The LP was preceded by an EP made up of three songs, in order to test the market. The immediate sale of 300,000 copies of the EP cemented the band's appeal. The first single \u201cM\u00e1tenme Porque Me Muero\u201d (\"Kill Me Because I'm Dying\") became a minor hit in Mexico City. The first three singles garnered sufficient radio play.\n\nIn December 1988 Caifanes released a cover of Cuban folk singer Guillermo Rodriguez Fiffe's classic cumbia (tropical dance song), \u201cLa Negra Tomasa,\u201d (The Black Woman Tomasa) as a Maxi single. The song was a massive hit in Mexico and introduced Caifanes to a wider audience nationally and abroad.\n\nNational success\n\nBy 1989, Caifanes had emerged as one of the hottest rock acts to come from central Mexico. In June Caifanes played two sold-out shows at Mexico's Auditorio Nacional (National Auditorium), a 10,000 person venue \u2013 a first for a Mexican rock band."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.282446502198141282089304244865401461797", "context": "In late 1989, Caifanes began to record their second album in New York City. The record was produced by Oscar Lopez, aided by Gustavo Santaolalla and Daniel Freiberg. El diablito (The Little Devil) was released in July 1990 through BMG Records. The band now included former Insolitas guitarist Alejandro Marcovich. Marcovich's textural guitar work considerably changed Caifanes\u2019 sound and cemented the \u201cclassic\u201d Mexican rock sound that Caifanes became famous for. \u201cLa C\u00e9lula Que Explota\u201d (The Cell that Explodes), with its brushes of mariachi and bolero guitars and a crescendo of mariachi trumpets and its music video directed by Juan Carlos Col\u00edn became both a signature of the band as well as a massive hit in 1990 and 1991.\n\nBy this time, Caifanes along with Man\u00e1, Fobia, Maldita Vecindad, La Lupita, Cafe Tacuba and Los Amantes de Lola, helped to move Mexican Rock toward a wider audience and catapulted the Rock En Espa\u00f1ol movement of the 1990s.\n\nIn 1992, Caifanes released El Silencio (The Silence). Recorded in Wisconsin and produced by Adrian Belew, of King Crimson fame, El Silencio further had a more direct guitar driven sound. \u201cNo Dejes Que\u201d (Don't Let It\u201d), \u201cEstas Dormida\u201d (You're Sleeping), \u201cDebajo de Tu Piel\u201d (Under Your Skin), and the soaring \u201cNubes\u201d (Clouds) would go on to become Mexican rock staples. The influence of Belew, who also played guitar on the album, was felt strongest in \u201cHasta Morir\u201d (Until Death), \u201cTortuga\u201d (Turtle), and \u201cVamos a Hacer un Silencio\u201d (Let's Make a Silence). With its string of hits and hybrid of rock and traditional Mexican music, El silencio is considered to be one of the most influential records of the Rock En Espa\u00f1ol genre. Caifanes toured extensively in support of the album. By this time, the group had started to make inroads into Central and South America as well as in the United States. In August 1992 Caifanes sold out the Hollywood Palladium. In 1993 Caifanes became the first Mexican rock group to sell out Mexico City's Palacio de los Deportes (Sports Palace)."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.281170903217755215997141396343009752479", "context": "By late 1993, Caifanes became a three piece with the exit of Romo and Herrera. Federico Fong filled in on bass and Yann Zaragoza played keyboards. 1994's El nervio del volc\u00e1n (\"The Volcano\u2019s Nerve\"), released by BMG, showed Caifanes with a heavier, more progressive sound. Without the distractions of Romo's lively and fluid bass playing or Herrera's atmospheric keyboards, Marcovich's staccato guitar work, Alfonso's polyrythmic drumming, and Hernandez's brooding and haunting vocal style became even more prominent. \u201cAfuera\u201d (\"Outside\"), the first single, fused rock grooves with an ethnic-inspired guitar solo. \u201cAqu\u00ed No Es As\u00ed\u201d (\u201cHere Is Not Like That \u201d), and \"Ayer Me Dijo Un Ave\" (\u201cYesterday a Bird said to me...\u201d) became radio favorites. \u201cAqu\u00ed No Es As\u00ed\u201d achieved great success in Mexico and several countries of Latin-America, it became the last massive hit of the band, shortly before their breakup, and its music video, directed by Carlos Marcovich (Alejandro's brother, who also directed \"Afuera\") tells the history of the Spanish conquest of Mexico and the Aztec Empire in just one shot.\n\nIn 1994, Caifanes were at the height of their popularity. Caifanes along with Mana was one of Mexico's premier stadium rock acts, selling out stadiums in Mexico and large venues throughout Latin America and the United States. They were a staple in Latin MTV, Rock en Espa\u00f1ol radio and appeared regularly at music festivals. In 1994, Caifanes opened up for the Rolling Stones in Mexico City and participated in Peter Gabriel's WOMAD festival.\n\nBreakup\n1995 marked the end of Caifanes. The relationship between Hern\u00e1ndez and Marcovich was strained. On 18 August 1995, Caifanes played their final show in San Luis Potos\u00ed. A legal scuffle over the name \u201cCaifanes\u201d ensued, forcing Sa\u00fal Hern\u00e1ndez to choose the name Jaguares (Jaguars) for his new project, which was not a radical departure from the Caifanes sound. Hern\u00e1ndez was joined by former Caifanes and Insolitas drummer Alfonso Andr\u00e9."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.6181021754720908368005739161225930069", "context": "Reunion\nOn December 14, 2010, it was announced that the band would be reuniting for the Vive Latino festival and the Coachella Festival of 2011, after a reconciliation between Hern\u00e1ndez and Marcovich.\n\nAfter not having recorded since 1994, the band released a new single, \"Heridos\".

It was extremely out of the ordinary for a Mexican band at the time to wear makeup, dress in black, and have disheveled hair.\n\nInfluence on the Mexican rock scene \nThe presence of Caifanes and the media coverage forced record companies to take existing groups seriously as well as to revitalize veteran rock figures that had long careers behind them, such as El Tri. , , Alquima, and Maldita Vecindad were the first signings. Man\u00e1 and El Tri already had records out to take advantage of the surge in media support. Fobia gives enormous credit to the influence of Caifanes on their music, (Hernandez collaborated in the production of the demos Puedo Rascarme Solo, La Iguana, and Moscas for a television show. Saul offered moral support to Fobia and helped them sign with BMG Ariola). Many other bands owe their existence in the media to Caifanes: Santa Sabina, La Casta\u00f1eda, , Maldita Vecindad, La Cuca, La Lupita, the ska band , , Botellita de Jerez, and many more.

The basic idea is to prepare the files to make them feasible for the correct process such as offset printing and eliminate costly errors and facilitate a smooth production. It is a standard prepress procedure in the printing industry (as it is imposition). The term originates from the preflight checklists used by pilots. The term was first used in a presentation at the Color Connections conference in 1990 by consultant Chuck Weger, and Professor Ron Bertolina was a pioneer for solutions to preflighting in the 1990s.\n\nBackground\nIn a common digital prepress workflow, a collection of computer files provided by clients will be translated from an application-specific format such as Adobe InDesign or QuarkXPress to a format that the raster image processor (RIP) can interpret. But before this rasterization occurs, workers in the prepress department confirm the incoming materials to make sure they are ready to be sent to the RIP. This is an important step because it prevents production delays caused by missing materials or improperly prepared materials. Once the incoming materials have passed the pre-flight check, they are ready to be put into production and sent to the RIP.\n\nFiles were originally printed as Adobe PostScript; however in modern workflows, PDF files have become the popular file type for submitting data to a RIP. The RIP generates the final raster image that will be printed directly (as in desktop inkjet or laser printing), set to photographic film or paper (using an imagesetter), or transferred direct-to-plate."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.169455216731542470206164644291809308913", "context": "Depending on the hardware and software components and configurations, RIPs can experience problems rasterizing the image data contained in PostScript or PDF files. If there is a failure in rasterizing the image, it can be costly, as output systems (printers, plate-setters, etc.) consume expensive supplies, can require extensive amounts of time to process complex image data, and require skilled labor to operate.\n\nThe preflight process\nThe process of preflighting a file helps reduce the likelihood of rasterization problems that cause production delays. Page layout software applications (which allow users to combine images, graphics, and text from a variety of formats) automate portions of the preflight process. Typically, client-provided materials are verified by a preflight operator for completeness and to confirm that the incoming materials meet the production requirements.

Many desktop publishing applications have some type of preflight capability, however they may not be as robust as commercial applications. Many printers and publishers utilize high-end preflight and file optimization solutions rather than relying on those within desktop publishing apps. They will make sure the preflight settings match their specific production requirements.\n\nHistory\nProfessor Ron Bertolina was a pioneer of the preflighting concept in electronic publishing. In the mid 1990s, he wrote published technical articles and conducted workshops across the US on preflighting for the Graphic Arts Technical Foundation. His preflight checklist, included in the article \"Preflighting Digital Files\" for GATFWorld magazine, became a standard for printing companies to follow to help to reduce costly errors and thus was a great benefit to the publishing industry.

The climactic finale at the bowling alley and ice skating rink was filmed at two separate locations.  The former Grand Central Bowl in Glendale, California stood in for the bowling alley (the building still stands as part of the Disney Imagineering complex, and was also filmed as Jack Rabbit Slims in Pulp Fiction), while the ice skating rink scenes were filmed at the former Rollerdrome in Culver City, California (immediately prior to the building being torn down in August, 1971 to make way for Tellefson Park). The party scene was filmed in a loft in Venice, California. In an interview in Fangoria magazine, screenwriter and first time producer Anthony Harris stated that a good portion of the filmed material was improvised on the set, and that his script was ignored. While in production, Harris was also in the process of preparing a second sequel, Curse of the Blob, but these plans were never implemented.\n\nContrary to the original 1958 film, in which the Blob was largely portrayed by gallons of silicone dyed red, which needed to be repeatedly stirred to maintain the consistent red color, the Blob in Beware! the Blob was mostly created from a red-dyed powder blended with water to form the desired consistency. The Blob was alternately created from other materials as well, including a large red plastic balloon, semi-transparent red plastic sheeting illuminated with a backlight, and a large rotating red drum of hard red silicone placed in front of the camera lens."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.136259517430500933618406940644883098675", "context": "Renowned cinematographer Dean Cundey, who would later go on to be a cinematographer on such films as Halloween, The Thing, the Back to the Future series and Jurassic Park, worked on Beware!

Cundey was also the camera operator on second unit shots of the Blob eating the fly, the kitten, etc.\n\nBeware! The Blob was intended as a December, 1971 release, but was held back until June, 1972 to capitalize on the lucrative summer movie and drive-in theater audience. An exceptional film marketer, Harris later paired the movie with other films he to which held the rights (notably Equinox), and renamed the film Son of Blob in some markets as a test title. The film premiered on television in 1974.\n\nRelease\nIn 1982, the film was re-issued with the tagline \"The film that J.R. shot!\" in an attempt to capitalize on the success of Hagman's television series Dallas, using a twist on the show's popular meme, \"Who shot J.R.?\"\n\nHome media\nAs Son of Blob together with The Blob, the film was released on DVD by Umbrella Entertainment in September 2011.

Extremal regions are well defined on images if:\n  is totally ordered (total, antisymmetric and transitive binary relations  exist).\n An adjacency relation  is defined. We will denote that two points are adjacent as .\n\nRegion  is a contiguous (aka connected) subset of . (For each  there is a sequence  such as .)

As far as  is totally ordered, we can reformulate these conditions as  for maximum intensity region and  for minimum intensity region, respectively. In this form we can use a notion of a threshold intensity value which separates the region and its boundary.\n\nMaximally stable extremal region Let  an extremal region such as all points on it have an intensity smaller than . Note  for all positive . Extremal region  is maximally stable if and only if  has a local minimum at .

If a region  is not significantly larger than a region , region  is taken as a maximally stable region.\n\nThe concept more simply can be explained by thresholding. All the pixels below a given threshold are 'black' and all those above or equal are 'white'. Given a source image, if a sequence of thresholded result images  is generated where each image  corresponds to an increasing threshold t, first a white image would be seen, then 'black' spots corresponding to local intensity minima will appear then grow larger. A maximally stable extremal region is found when size of one of these black areas is the same (or near the same) than in previous image.\n\nThese 'black' spots will eventually merge, until the whole image is black. The set of all connected components in the sequence is the set of all extremal regions. In that sense, the concept of MSER is linked to the one of component tree of the image. The component tree indeed provide an easy way for implementing MSER.\n\nExtremal regions \nExtremal regions in this context have two important properties, that the set is closed under...\n continuous transformation of image coordinates. This means it is affine invariant and it doesn't matter if the image is warped or skewed.\n monotonic transformation of image intensities. The approach is of course sensitive to natural lighting effects as change of day light or moving shadows.\n\nAdvantages of MSER \nBecause the regions are defined exclusively by the intensity function in the region and the outer border, this leads to many key characteristics of the regions which make them useful. Over a large range of thresholds, the local binarization is stable in certain regions, and have the properties listed below."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.243188491935719224840446290651416309881", "context": "Invariance to affine transformation of image intensities\n Covariance to adjacency preserving (continuous) transformation  on the image domain\n Stability: only regions whose support is nearly the same over a range of thresholds is selected.\n Multi-scale detection without any smoothing involved, both fine and large structure is detected.Note, however, that detection of MSERs in a scale pyramid improves repeatability, and number of correspondences across scale changes.\n The set of all extremal regions can be enumerated in worst-case , where  is the number of pixels in the image.\n\nComparison to other region detectors\nIn Mikolajczyk et al., six region detectors are studied (Harris-affine, Hessian-affine, MSER, edge-based regions, intensity extrema, and salient regions).

Though large regions may be slightly easier to match.\n Viewpoint change \u2013 MSER outperforms the five other region detectors in both the original images and those with repeated texture motifs.\n Scale change \u2013 Following Hessian-affine detector, MSER comes in second under a scale change and in-plane rotation.\n Blur \u2013 MSER proved to be the most sensitive to this type of change in image, the only area in which this type of detection is lacking.Note however that this evaluation did not make use of multi-resolution detection, which has been shown to improve repeatability under blur.\n Light change \u2013 MSER showed the highest repeatability score for this type of scene, with all the other having good robustness as well."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.233911895669671240601219732671633697355", "context": "MSER consistently resulted in the highest score through many tests, proving it to be a reliable region detector.\n\nImplementation \nThe original algorithm of Matas et al. is  in the number  of pixels. It proceeds by first sorting the pixels by intensity. This would take  time, using BINSORT. After sorting, pixels are marked in the image, and the list of growing and merging connected components and their areas is maintained using the union-find algorithm. This would take  time. In practice these steps are very fast. During this process, the area of each connected component as a function of intensity is stored producing a data structure. A merge of two components is viewed as termination of existence of the smaller component and an insertion of all pixels of the smaller component into the larger one. In the extremal regions, the 'maximally stable' ones are those corresponding to thresholds where the relative area change as a function of relative change of threshold is at a local minimum, i.e. the MSER are the parts of the image where local binarization is stable over a large range of thresholds.\n\nThe component tree is the set of all connected components of the thresholds of the image, ordered by inclusion. Efficient (quasi-linear whatever the range of the weights) algorithms for computing it do exist.

First MSER regions are computed on the intensity image (MSER+) and on the inverted image (MSER-). Measurement regions are selected at multiple scales: the size of the actual region, 1.5x, 2x, and 3x scaled convex hull of the region. Matching is accomplished in a robust manner, so it is better to increase the distinctiveness of large regions without being severely affected by clutter or non-planarity of the region's pre-image. A measurement taken from an almost planar patch of the scene with stable invariant description are called a 'good measurement'. Unstable ones or those on non-planar surfaces or discontinuities are called 'corrupted measurements'. The robust similarity is computed:\nFor each  on region  regions  from the other image with the corresponding i-th measurement  nearest to  are found and a vote is cast suggesting correspondence of A and each of . Votes are summed over all measurements, and using probability analysis, 'good measurements' can be picked out as the 'corrupt measurements' will likely spread their votes randomly. By applying RANSAC to the centers of gravity of the regions, a rough epipolar geometry can be computed. An affine transformation between pairs of potentially corresponding regions is computed, and correspondences define it up to a rotation, which is then determined by epipolar lines. The regions are then filtered, and the ones with correlation of their transformed images above a threshold are chosen. RANSAC is applied again with a more narrow threshold, and the final epipolar geometry is estimated by the eight-point algorithm.\n\nThis algorithm can be tested here (Epipolar or homography geometry constrained matches): WBS Image Matcher"}, {"source": "bitagent.source.71808606735418089746693989515496608012", "context": "Use in text detection\nThe MSER algorithm has been used in text detection by Chen by combining MSER with Canny edges. Canny edges are used to help cope with the weakness of MSER to blur. MSER is first applied to the image in question to determine the character regions. To enhance the MSER regions any pixels outside the boundaries formed by Canny edges are removed. The separation of the later provided by the edges greatly increase the usability of MSER in the extraction of blurred text.\nAn alternative use of MSER in text detection is the work by Shi using a graph model. This method again applies MSER to the image to generate preliminary regions. These are then used to construct a graph model based on the position distance and color distance between each MSER, which is treated as a node. Next the nodes are separated into foreground and background using cost functions. One cost function is to relate the distance from the node to the foreground and background. The other penalizes nodes for being significantly different from its neighbor. When these are minimized the graph is then cut to separate the text nodes from the non-text nodes. To enable text detection in a general scene, Neumann uses the MSER algorithm in a variety of projections. In addition to the greyscale intensity projection, he uses the red, blue, and green color channels to detect text regions that are color distinct but not necessarily distinct in greyscale intensity. This method allows for detection of more text than solely using the MSER+ and MSER- functions discussed above.\n\nExtensions and adaptations"}, {"source": "bitagent.source.208484787494550341796468186137355970307", "context": "The MSER algorithm has been adapted to colour images, by replacing thresholding of the intensity function with agglomerative clustering, based on colour gradients.\n The MSER algorithm can be used to detect regions based on color as opposed to intensity.

The MSER algorithm is then run five times; over the three color pseudo-intensities and then over the grey scale intensities using the standard MSER+ and MSER- functions.\n The MSER algorithm can be used to track colour objects, by performing MSER detection on the Mahalanobis distance to a colour distribution.\n By detecting MSERs in multiple resolutions, robustness to blur, and scale change can be improved.\n\nOther applications\n Shape Descriptors for Maximally Stable Extremal Regions\n Efficient Maximally Stable Extremal Region (MSER) Tracking\n N-tree Disjoint-Set Forests for Maximally Stable Extremal Regions\n Video Google and Object Level Grouping for Video Shots\n Real-Time Extraction of Maximally Stable Extremal Regions on an FPGA\n Maximally Stable Colour Regions for Recognition and Matching\n\nSee also\n\n Blob detection\n Feature detection (computer vision)\n\nExternal links\n VLFeat, an open source computer vision library in C (with a MEX interface to MATLAB), including an implementation of MSER\n OpenCV, an open source computer vision library in C/C++, including an implementation of Linear Time MSER\n Detector Repeatabilty Study, Kristian Mikolajczyk Binaries (Win/Linux to compute MSER/HarrisAffine... .

The commentator for the event was Joey Styles. The referees were Jim Molineaux, John Finnegan, John Moore, and Paul Richards.\n\nThe first bout was a singles match between Devon Storm and El Puerto Rique\u00f1o. Storm won the match by pinfall following a diving bulldog. \n\nThe second bout was a singles match between Mikey Whipwreck and Rob Van Dam. At the outset of the match, Brian Pillman - who had begun disrupting ECW events by behaving erratically - came to ringside in a wheelchair and inexplicably demanded the match be stopped, then hit Whipwreck with his crutch after Whipwreck confronted him. Van Dam went on to win the match by pinfall following a standing moonsault.

The Full Blooded Italians won by disqualification after D-Von Dudley gave the referee a chair shot. Following the match, D-Von Dudley attacked Buh Buh Ray Dudley and the other Dudley Brothers at ringside (Chubby Dudley, Dances with Dudley, and Sign Guy Dudley), giving them all chair shots.

Taz won the match by submission using the Tazmission. Following the match, Taz brawled with mixed martial artist Paul Varelans, who was seated at ringside, setting up a bout between them at Hardcore Heaven later that month.\n\nThe fifth bout was a falls count anywhere six-man tag team elimination match pitting Raven's Nest members Brian Lee and the Bruise Brothers against The Pitbulls and Tommy Dreamer.

Richards and his henchman the Blue Meanie - who regularly impersonated other wrestlers - came to the ring dressed as World Championship Wrestling tag team the Blue Bloods. Richards - who had announced earlier that year at Big Apple Blizzard Blast that he intended to sue the Sandman's valet Missy Hyatt for sexual harassment for kissing him the previous December at Holiday Hell - then served Hyatt by stuffing the summons into her cleavage.

Johnson reports that Wintjiya was born at Mulparingya, \"a swamp and spring to the northeast of Kintore\", west of Alice Springs. As was the case for a number of artists from the region, Wintjiya's family walked into the Haasts Bluff settlement in the 1950s, moving to Papunya in the 1960s. In 1981, Kintore was established and the family moved there. Her native language is Pintupi, and she speaks almost no English.

Their work, which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures, rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia, particularly after the introduction of a government-sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983. By the 1980s and '90s, such work was being exhibited internationally. The first artists, including all of the founders of the Papunya Tula artists' company, were men, and there was resistance among the Pintupi men of central Australia to women also painting. However, many of the women wished to participate, and in the 1990s many of them began to paint. In the western desert communities such as Kintore, Yuendumu, Balgo, and on the outstations, people were beginning to create art works expressly for exhibition and sale."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.192751832589729489235437596760211064100", "context": "Career \nSince the 1970s Wintjiya had created artefacts such as ininti seed necklaces, mats and baskets, using traditional artistic techniques including weaving of spinifex grass. When the women of Kintore, including sisters Wintjiya and Tjunkiya, started creating canvasses, their works bore little resemblance to those of their male peers (who had been painting for some years). Wintjiya's first efforts were collaborative, as one of a group of women who created murals on the Kintore Women's Centre walls in 1992. She then joined a painting camp with other women from Kintore and Haasts Bluff to produce \"a series of very large collaborative canvases of the group's shared Dreamings\" (dreamings are stories used to pass \"important knowledge, cultural values and belief systems\" from generation to generation). Twenty-five women were involved in planning the works, which included three canvases that were  square, as well as two that were ; Tjunkiya and Wintjiya performed a ceremonial dance as part of the preparations. Wintjiya and her sister were determined to participate in the project despite cataracts interfering with their vision. As was the case for Makinti Napanangka, an operation to remove cataracts resulted in a new brightness to Wintjiya's compositions. Sources differ on when Wintjiya and her sister Tjunkiya had their cataracts removed: Johnson suggests 1999, but art centre coordinator Marina Strocchi, who worked closely with the women, states that it was 1994. In the early 2000s Wintjiya and her sister painted at Kintore, but in 2008 they were working from their home: \"the widows' camp outside her 'son' Turkey Tolson's former residence\"."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.58898786774898234857967197914581373325", "context": "Tjunkiya and her sister Wintjiya did not confine their activities to painting canvases. In 2001 the National Gallery of Victoria purchased a collaborative batik, created by the sisters in cooperation with several other artists, together with one completed by Wintjiya alone. These works were the product of a batik workshop run for the women of Haasts Bluff by Northern Territory Education Department staff Jill Squires and Therese Honan in the months following June 1994. The works, including several by Wintjiya, were not completed until 1995. Circular markings, used by Wintjiya in both these batiks and her subsequent paintings, represent the eggs of the flying ant (waturnuma), one of the main subjects of her art. She also portrays \"tree-like organic motifs\" and representations of hair-string skirts (nyimparra). The sisters also gained experience with drypoint etching; works produced by Wintjiya in 2004 \u2013 Watiyawanu and Nyimpara \u2013 are held by the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nWintjiya's work was included in a survey of the history of Papunya Tula painting hosted by Flinders University in the late 1990s. Reviewing the exhibition, Christine Nicholls remarked of Wintjiya's Watanuma that it was a germinal painting, with fine use of muted colour, and showed sensitivity to the relationships between objects and spaces represented in the work. Likewise, Marina Strocchi has noted the contrast between some of the subtle colours used in batik and Wintjiya's characteristic painting palette, which is \"almost exclusively stark white with black or red\".

While complaints regarding proceedings over antisemitism and other forms of racism and discrimination had existed prior to Corbyn's election as leader, over the course of his leadership they seemed to have become more numerous and intense.

He created Misao to be as \"bright\" as possible since the story was scheduled to be \"in a dark direction.\" Watsuki added that \"It's though Yahiko + Kaoru / 2 = Misao.\" The author of Rurouni Kenshin gave her an association with the Oniwabansh\u016b, stemming from the reader suggestion of an Oniwabansh\u016b kunoichi. To prevent additional complications in the storyline, Watsuki wanted Misao as a character who would not develop romantic feelings for Kenshin. Her design originates from Nakoruru in Samurai Shodown (Samurai Spirits); according to Watsuki he received criticism for this. Watsuki believes that she is closer to Mai Shiranui and Yuri Sakazaki from another SNK \"battle-game.\" According to Watsuki the setup of the physical design occurred very quickly as he \"fussed\" with an Oniwabansh\u016b ninja outfit \"a bit.\" Watsuki intended for Misao's face and body to resemble that of a young man. While Misao is 16, Watsuki wanted her to appear like a 13-year-old. Watsuki argued with his editors  about the inclusion of Misao's braid. Ultimately it was kept since it added emphasis to Misao's movements. Watsuki said that he added the cloak \"just for fun.\" The creator of Rurouni Kenshin intended for her to have a \"painful\" encounter with Aoshi in the future, but that Misao would \"keep going strong.\" Watsuki said that he enjoyed drawing Misao.

She was in the care of the last leader of the Oniwabanash\u016b Shinomori Aoshi until Aoshi, Han'nya, Shikij\u014d, Beshimi, and Hyottoko left her to Kashiwazaki Nenji, also known as Okina of the Oniwabanash\u016b, when she was eight. She and Okina had a strong bond, though in Misao's mind, Aoshi remained the best. She also had a special affection for Han'nya, who was always the one to take care of her and taught her how to fight. When she heard that Aoshi was in Tokyo, she went to search for him and runs into Himura Kenshin on the way back to Kyoto.\n\nKyoto Arc\nWhile resting in a forest on the way to Kyoto to defeat Shishio Makoto, Kenshin notices a teenaged girl, Misao, defeat four bandits and take their goods. He interrupts her midway through the altercation, but she views him as a bum. She determines to take his sword but Kenshin easily avoids her attacks. She and Kenshin then begin traveling to Kyoto together. They stop near Shingetsu Village, where they meet a young boy. He tells them that his village is under control of Shishio Makoto. Misao and Kenshin, later accompanied by Sait\u014d Hajime, free the village. As the story progresses Misao, who has become rather attached to Kenshin, becomes angry at him for not depending on anyone else. After Kenshin leaves, she met Kamiya Kaoru and My\u014djin Yahiko when she recognizes a picture of Kenshin posted on the wall of a restaurant called Shirobeko. Misao takes Kaoru and Yahiko to Kenshin at his Hiko Seij\u016br\u014d's home. On the way back, Yahiko remembers that he forgot to warn Kenshin about Aoshi, who he had seen in Kyoto a few days before, and says it out loud. Misao had heard of this and demands to know about Aoshi; Kaoru complies, grateful for the chance to see Kenshin again."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.99626316287926103092768641117474887664", "context": "Misao was shocked at the news of Han'nya's and the others' deaths, and she runs back to Aoi-Ya for clarification from Okina. She discovers that Okina went to fight Aoshi, and leaves immediately. She arrives too late to stop the fight and finds Okina barely alive and Aoshi declaring he never wishes to see Misao again. She was also given a letter written by Okina in case he was to die, telling her that she should forget about Aoshi and Oniwabanshu so she can lead a normal life. While she has difficulty accepting Aoshi is the one who attempted to kill Okina. She declares herself as the new Okashira of the Oniwabanash\u016b and refuses to recognize Aoshi as the clan's head any longer.\n\nMisao becomes close friends with Kenshin, Kaoru, and Yahiko and helps them fight the agents of Shishio Makoto. Before leaving for the final battle with Shishio, Kenshin promises Misao that he will bring Aoshi back home to Aoi-Ya, because he does not believe that Aoshi has lost himself completely. She was overwhelmed with this knowledge and cannot stop her own tears, especially because before Kenshin made his statement, Okina had asked him to kill Aoshi.\n\nDuring the fight with members of the Ten Swords outside Aoi-Ya, Misao is knocked unconscious after fully receiving a hit from Honj\u014d Kamatari's weapon. Han'nya appears before her in a dream and tells her that Kenshin has kept his promise and is bringing Aoshi back. She wakes up and helps Kaoru defeat Kamatari. She also knocks Kamatari out when he attempts to kill himself to atone for his defeat; she says she cannot truly understand the feelings of a homosexual man, but was touched by his loyalty to Shishio.

Kaoru was dead and Kenshin has suffered a complete breakdown, going off to a village of lost men.

Nevertheless, the critic praised the work of Meg Bauman as Misao's actress. Mania.com noted her Misao \"provides a lot of comedic relief when it's needed, though her obsession with Aoshi borderlines on scary\". Nevertheless, Mania enjoyed how the plot changes when she allies with Kenshin. Similarly, Misao's portrayal in the live-action was portrayed for balancing a dark narrative with her optimism. Neverhtless the writer found that Misao's journey to find Shinomori might give her a grim fate as result of what happened to her friends. Kotaku claimed that despite the liveactions have a large cast, Misao and her allies from the Oniwabanshu are well developed.

SASP disrupts normal tissue function by producing chronic inflammation, induction of fibrosis and inhibition of stem cells. Chronic inflammation associated with aging has been termed inflammaging, although SASP may be only one of the possible causes of this condition.

Among its amenities were \"drawing-room and stateroom sleeping cars, dining cars, smoking and library cars, and observation cars.\" Many passengers passed the time simply walking between cars \"just to enjoy the unusual experience of being able to do so without having their hats blown away.\"\n\nSoon the Washington-to-Atlanta routing expanded via the West Point Route from Atlanta to Montgomery and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad from Montgomery to New Orleans, via Mobile. The route was then extended to New York (Jersey City before 1910) along the Pennsylvania Railroad's northeastern trunk line, now Northeast Corridor, via a connection in Washington with the Congressional Limited. Scheduled time for the New York-to-New Orleans run was advertised as a \"40-hour, unprecedented\" trip. Because of the popularity of this service, the Vestibule became a solid train of walk-through cars between New York and New Orleans. It also carried the first dining cars to operate between those two cities.\n\nThe new train's popularity was not enough to prevent the R&D from being forced into receivership in 1892. Two years later, the R&D merged with five other railroads to form the Southern Railway Company.

No. 97 had operated over the same tracks as No. 38 between Washington, D.C., and Atlanta, and over the same trestle where No. 97 wrecked in 1903.  The original songwriter was a Southern Railway employee, who certainly knew which train was No. 38.\n\nThe Southern Railway and Southern Pacific discussed the possibility of running a single train from Washington, D.C., to Los Angeles via New Orleans, which would have become the first truly transcontinental passenger train. The idea never came to fruition, but from 1993 to 2005, Amtrak's Sunset Limited was a transcontinental train running between Orlando, Florida, and Los Angeles.\n\nAccording to railroad historian Mike Schafer,\nBy 1925, the train was re-equipped and renamed the Crescent Limited, a true all-Pullman extra-fare train. . . .  By 1938 the name became simply the Crescent.  It was dieselized in 1941 and streamlined in 1949.

It stopped only to discharge passengers, and only boarded passengers bound for destinations north of Washington. Arrival in Washington was about 4:00\u00a0a.m., but a sleeping car was uncoupled there and passengers could sleep until a more reasonable hour. The PRR carried the train north of Washington under a longstanding haulage agreement, pulling it into New York City in the morning.\n\nSouthbound, early evening departures from Washington (which had left New York in mid-afternoon) ran all-Pullman from Washington and arrived the next morning in Atlanta. Although the train carried coach cars (and made more stops) between Atlanta and New Orleans, it arrived in the early evening in the Crescent City to connect with the Sunset Limited for Texas and California. The Crescent sometimes exchanged a through sleeper with the Sunset, creating a transcontinental Pullman service in which a passenger's sleeping accommodation ran from New York City (or Washington) all the way to Los Angeles.\n\nAs passenger service dwindled, the northbound Crescent was combined with the Peach Queen, with through Atlanta-New York coaches.

The Crescent took a coastal route over Atlanta & West Point Railroad, Western Railway of Alabama and Louisville & Nashville Railroad trackage between New Orleans and Atlanta via Mobile and Montgomery; the Southerner stayed inland to run exclusively on Southern Railway trackage through Birmingham. For the combined Southern Crescent, Southern moved the train to the Birmingham route instead of the Mobile route. Although the Birmingham route was slightly less direct than the more coastal Mobile/Montgomery route, it afforded Southern the dispatch reliability of moving the train exclusively over its own right of way between Washington to New Orleans, and also allowed Southern to maintain its passenger service standards. The train was numbered 1 southbound and 2 northbound. Penn Central carried the Southern Crescent between Washington and New York along the Northeast Corridor, inheriting the longstanding haulage agreement from the Pennsylvania Railroad.

For a portion of the mid-1970s, Southern only operated tri-weekly between Atlanta and New Orleans, and carried a run-through Amtrak 10-6 sleeper on those days to connect to the Sunset Limited. On occasion, when Southern deemed an Amtrak car to be short of Southern standards, it substituted a Southern sleeper in the consist. Also, one of the two dome coaches in the Southern car fleet was added for the leg south of Atlanta.\n\nThe Southern Crescent was one of the two last privately operated long-distance passenger services in the United States, the other being the Rio Grande Zephyr.

ASTI ensures all students are involved in challenging learning experiences through its deliberate focus on rigorous and accelerated instruction in a well-defined academic course of study.  The ASTI curriculum explicitly provides for reinforcement of literacy in areas that are crucial to college success. Through its concentration on writing and speaking, ASTI prepares its students with the skills necessary to promote college-level language production and content presentation.

He wrote more than 230 books on a wide variety of subjects, both fiction and non-fiction, and was one of the most prolific English writers of detective fiction.\n\nEarly life and education \nFletcher was born in Halifax, West Yorkshire, the son of a clergyman. His father died when he was eight months old, and after which his grandmother raised him on a farm in Darrington, near Pontefract. He was educated at Silcoates School in Wakefield, and after some study of law, he became a journalist.\n\nWriting career \nAt age 20, Fletcher began working in journalism, as a sub-editor in London. He subsequently returned to his native Yorkshire, where he worked first on the Leeds Mercury using the pseudonym A Son of the Soil, and then as a special correspondent for the Yorkshire Post covering Edward VII's coronation in 1902.\n\nFletcher's first books published were poetry. He then moved on to write numerous works of historical fiction and history, many dealing with Yorkshire, which led to his selection as a fellow of the Royal Historical Society.\n\nMichael Sadleir stated that Fletcher's historical novel, When Charles I Was King (1892), was his best work. Fletcher wrote several novels of rural life in imitation of Richard Jefferies, beginning with The Wonderful Wapentake (1894).\n\nIn 1914, Fletcher wrote his first detective novel and went on to write over a hundred more, many featuring the private investigator Ronald Camberwell."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.31010967780777189288663143388022697727", "context": "Fletcher published multiple crime fiction novels during the \"Golden Age of Detective Fiction,\" namely his The Middle Temple Murder (1919) which served as the basic formulaic template for writing detective fiction novels; though, this particular novel (in addition to many of his others) did not share many general traits with those that characterize this particular literary era. On the contrary, it's argued that Fletcher is an almost exact contemporary of Conan Doyle. Most of his detective fiction works considerably pre-date that era, and even those few published within it do not conform to the closed form and strict rules professed, if not unfailingly observed, by the Golden Age writers.\n\nPersonal life \nHe was married to the Irish writer Rosamond Langbridge, with whom he had one son, Rev. Valentine Fletcher, who held various ministries across Yorkshire, including Bradford and Sedbergh, and was himself a writer, author of various children's books and of Chimney Pots and Stacks, on the British domestic chimney pot.\n\nDeath \nFletcher died in Surrey 1935, one week short of his 72nd birthday.

LNCaP cells are androgen-sensitive human prostate adenocarcinoma cells derived from the left supraclavicular lymph node metastasis from a 50-year-old caucasian male in 1977.  They are adherent epithelial cells growing in aggregates and as single cells.\n\nOne major obstacle to conducting the most clinically relevant prostate cancer (PCa) research has been the lack of cell lines that closely mimic human disease progression. Two hallmarks of metastatic human prostate cancer include the shift of aggressive PCa from androgen-sensitivity to an Androgen Insensitive (AI) state, and the propensity of PCa to metastasize to bone. Although the generation of AI cell lines has been quite successful as  demonstrated in the \u201cclassic\u201d cell lines DU145 and PC3, the behavior of these cells in bone does not fully mimic clinical human disease. It is well established that human PCa bone metastasis form osteoblastic lesions rather than osteolytic lesions seen in other cancers like breast cancer. Similarly, PC-3 and DU145 cells form osteolytic tumors.

Cells were subcutaneously injected at multiple sites into the mouse flank and after approximately 4 weeks of growth, tumors were easily detectable by physical examination and had a high rate of growth (17-33 mm3/day).\n\nTo replicate the hallmark shift of PCa cells to AI, LNCaP host mice were castrated by way of midscrotal incision at approximately 8 weeks post injection.

It covered a wide variety of topics, and was intended as a feminist counterpoint to Seventeen and YM magazines. Sassy existed between 1988 and 1996.\n\nHistory and profile\nThe magazine was founded in March 1988 by an Australian feminist, Sandra Yates, CEO of Matilda Publications, who based it on the teen magazine Dolly.\nWomen Aglow, an evangelical women's group, boycotted Sassy due to its content about sexuality immediately following its start.\n\nEditorial staff\nSassy'''s founding editor was Jane Pratt. Its original main writers were referred to by Pratt as \"Sex\" (Karen Catchpole), \"Drugs\" (Catherine Gysin), and \"Rock 'n Roll\" (Christina Kelly) because of the topics they covered. Executive Editor Mary Kaye Schilling became Editor-in-Chief in 1990, when Pratt went on to host a daytime talk show. When Schilling left, Christina Kelly was promoted to Editor and remained in that position until the magazine's end. Kelly hired Erin Smith of Bratmobile as her intern in 1991. The fashion department was headed by Mary Clarke, Jacinta Dobson, and Andrea Lee Linett, who discovered Chlo\u00eb Sevigny on the street and hired her as an intern. The distinctive look of the magazine was created by Cheryl Collins, who had worked at Australia's Dolly. When Collins left, Schilling hired Noel Claro to art direct the magazine.\n\nPublishersSassy was originally published in March 1988 in the United States by Matilda Publications with a circulation of 250,000. It was acquired by Lang Communications in October 1989, at which point its circulation was 450,000. Petersen Publishing officially took over with the February\u2013March 1995 issue, and its editorial offices were moved to Los Angeles from New York City.

It was created by Mark Lewman (words), Andy Jenkins (art direction) and Spike Jonze (photos), who went on to direct music videos and feature films. They were collectively known as \"the Master Cluster.\" According to Canadian author Douglas Coupland, \"Dirt was a funny and smart magazine for young people\".\n\nReader-produced issuesSassy anticipated \"crowd sourced\" content by over a decade, starting with their \"every single little thing in this issue is reader-produced\" December 1990 issue. Originally conceived by Alan Goodman's and Fred Seibert's Fred/Alan Inc., Sassy advertising agency.\n\nSassiest Boy in AmericaSassy conducted an annual search for the Sassiest Girl in America, and in 1990, Sassy magazine conducted a search for the Sassiest Boy in America. Over 150 entries were received, with the eventual winner being Ian Svenonius of Nation of Ulysses. In the story highlighting his selection, Pratt states, \"He's going to be a big deal. I'm sure he will be and we're going to be so proud that we were the first ones to discover him.\" However, it was discovered that Svenonius wasn't a \"boy\" at all, but rather lied about his age, as he was 22 at the time of his selection\u2014too old, per contest rules. He was allowed to retain his title.\n\nChia PetSassy's in-house band was named after the Chia Pet, with various members from the editorial staff, including Jane Pratt on violin, Mary Kaye Schilling and Christina Kelly on vocals, Kelly's then-husband Robert Weeks on guitar, her then-sister-in-law (and Sassy writer) Jessica Vitkus Weeks on bass guitar, Mary Ann Marshall (also a Sassy scribe) on drums.

In 2020, OSMTH and SMOTJ were recognized by the Augustan Society as a religious confraternity of knights. OSMTH and OSMTJ are often referred to simply as the Knights Templars. They make a moral and ethical claim to follow in the same spiritual path as the original Order of the Knights Templar. OSMTH and OSMTJ, which are open to Christians of any denomination, operate as a charity and an order of chivalry.\n\nHistory\n\nThe l'Ordre du Temple was made public in France in 1705 by Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, and claimed to be the continuation of the medieval Knights Templar, using the Larmenius Charter as evidence of its pedigree. The order was officially reconstituted in 1804 by Bernard-Raymond Fabr\u00e9-Palaprat, and recognized as an Order of Chivalry by its patron Napoleon Bonaparte in 1805. The Ordre du Temple was then under the administration of the KVMRIS lodge beginning in 1894 until it was registered as OSMTJ in 1932.\n\nIn 1970, a schism occurred within the Order when General Antoine Zdrojewski was unexpectedly elected as the new Grand Master at the Convent of Paris in September, 1970. Zdrojewski's following retained the French translation: \"Ordre Souverain et Militaire du Temple de J\u00e9rusalem\" (OSMTJ), until his death in 1989. Zdrojewski was succeeded by Georges Lamirand as the new head of the OSMTJ until his death in 1994. George Lamirand was succeeded by Nicolas Haimovici Hastier as OSMTJ International Leader until 2020, when Brigadier General Ronald S. Mangum was elected Grandmaster..\n\nThe faction which remained with de Sousa Fontes after the 1970 election used the Latin acronym OSMTH. In 1997, OSMTH voted to expel Grand Master Fernando de Sousa Fontes from the order. This resulted in another schism with those loyal to Fontes forming a new organization presently known as OSMTH-Regency while the remainder of the organization continued on as OSMTH."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.113652581373008450845621066772807474066", "context": "While OSMTH rituals and traditions are currently based upon those of the historical Knights Templar, according to its website and their present leader, Grand Master Patrick Rea, there is no direct historical lineage claimed by OSMTH and the 12th century Templars.

The Order is an associate member of the International Peace Bureau and an affiliate of the International Center for Religion & Diplomacy, which was founded by one of OSMTH's members. In 2014, OSMTH was elected as a board member of CoNGO (Conference of NGOs in consultative status with the United Nations.\n\nOrganisation\n\nThe order exists in each country under different jurisdictions.

Mondale won the Democratic Party's presidential nomination after convincing Frank Lautenberg, a previously unpledged party delegate, to support him. Lautenberg's vote gave Mondale the 1,967 delegate votes needed to become the Democratic Party's nominee. Mondale lost the general election, held on November 6, 1984, to incumbent Republican President Ronald Reagan in a landslide. Had Mondale been elected, he would have been the first U.S. president from Minnesota and the first non-incumbent vice president since Richard Nixon to take office as president. Ferraro would also have been the country's first female vice president, and the first person from New York since Nelson Rockefeller to become vice president, whereas her husband, John Zaccaro, would also have been the country's first second gentleman.\n\nBackground\n\nA former United States Senator from Minnesota, Mondale considered running for the Democratic nomination in the 1976 presidential election, but he dropped out of the race on November 21, 1974, after having built a campaign for two years. When he dropped out, he said that he felt he lacked \"the overwhelming desire to be President\" and wanted to avoid \"sleeping in Holiday Inns.\" In 1976, Jimmy Carter won the presidential election, with Mondale as his running mate. Mondale served as vice president under Carter from 1977 to 1981.

In early polls, Mondale had a comfortable lead over his primary rivals, and he was considered the front-runner for the nomination by odds makers. John Glenn was considered Mondale's closest rival early in the race, but Glenn's campaign collapsed early on, as did most of the other Democratic candidates' campaigns. In 1983, Mondale was endorsed by almost all AFL-CIO leaders, as well as by the National Organization for Women, who had not endorsed a candidate since they were founded 17 years earlier.\n\nAfter Mondale trounced Hart in the February 20, 1984 Iowa caucuses, getting 48% of the vote to Hart's 16%, many in the media thought that the primaries were effectively over. Mondale's fate soon began to turn, however, after Hart won the New Hampshire primary, which cost Mondale his front-runner status. In an attempt to regain it, he effectively deployed the phrase \"Where's the beef?\" to cast doubt on Hart's claim that he offered \"new ideas.\" During the course of all the primaries, Mondale got about 6.8 million votes, Hart 6.5 million, and Jackson 3.3 million.\n\nMondale clinched the nomination in June 1984 by receiving significantly more votes from superdelegates than Hart did. Lautenberg then stated, \"I believe it is time for Gary Hart to come home to the Democratic party and behind the nomination of Walter Mondale.\" Nevertheless, Hart refused to concede and instead announced his intention to challenge the results at the party's upcoming convention.\n\nDemocratic National Convention"}, {"source": "bitagent.source.194095771661077201705489442618745039996", "context": "Shortly before the 1984 Democratic National Convention, Mondale chose Bert Lance to be his campaign's general chairman, and unsuccessfully attempted to remove Charles Manatt from his position as party chairman.

On Mondale's decisions, one anonymous Democratic Party aide told the New York Times: \"It's a disaster. People are gulping hard. No one knows why he did it.\" His choice of Lance proved controversial because Lance had previously left his job in the Carter administration amid charges of bank fraud (of which he was later exonerated).\n\nMondale picked three-term Congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro to be his running mate on July 12, 1984, making her the first woman nominated for president or vice president by a major U.S. political party. The pick was intended to energize Mondale's campaign, which it did at first. This effect proved short-lived, however, as it was soon overshadowed by a scandal involving Ferraro's and her husband's finances.\n\nShortly before the general election, Mondale defended his choice of Ferraro as his running mate against Reagan, who had recently said that her nomination was not a major breaking point. Mondale replied that he chose Ferraro \"because she's the best,\" adding that \"She is far better prepared for her position than Mr. Reagan was when he was elected president of the United States.\"\n\nMondale officially accepted the Democratic Party's nomination at the 1984 Democratic National Convention. He delivered his acceptance speech on the night of July 19, 1984, climaxing that year's convention.

Some of these professionals also told the New York Times that they were \"amazed\" at the sloppy preparation the campaign put into organizing events. In October 1984, shortly before the election, Mondale attempted to focus on trying to win California. That effort included spending over $3 million on television advertising there and flying Mondale in for a rally shortly thereafter. That was part of his strategy to try to win at least one big Sun Belt state.\n\nIn the general election, Mondale was endorsed by The New York Times, The Philadelphia Inquirer, the Detroit Free Press, and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, among other newspapers.\n\nResults\nSoon after the election, Democrats offered multiple different theories for why Mondale lost in a landslide: Jesse Jackson argued that the Democrats had pandered too much to white men, and Mondale himself said in February 1985 that he lost because of his inability to appear compelling on television. William Raspberry disagreed with Mondale's self-assessment and argued, \"What cost Mondale was the perception that Reagan, while perhaps on the wrong side of a number of specific issues, generally stood for what most Americans stood for, while Mondale, though often on the right side of the specifics, didn't really stand for anything at all.\""}, {"source": "bitagent.source.322106438351561071575717855976106272319", "context": "Writing in the Washington Post in March 1985, Mark Shields argued, \"The single, biggest mistake made by candidate Mondale and his campaign was the failure to endorse and to embrace the Fair Tax plan of Sen.

The Savoy Theatre \u2013 built as a showcase for the popular series of comic operas of Gilbert and Sullivan \u2013 was entirely lit by electricity in 1881.\n\nThe Society of London Theatre (SOLT) announced that 2018 was a record year for the capital's theatre industry with attendances topping 15.5 million for the first time since the organization began collecting audience data in 1986. Box office revenues exceeded \u00a3765 million. While attendance in 2019 was down 1.4% compared to the previous year, box office revenues reached a record \u00a3799 million. Famous screen actors, British and international alike, frequently appear on the London stage.\n\nThe majority of West End theatres are owned by the Ambassador Theatre Group, Delfont Mackintosh Theatres, Nimax Theatres, LW Theatres, and the Nederlander Organization.\n\nHistory\n\nTheatre in London flourished after the English Reformation. The first permanent public playhouse, known as The Theatre, was constructed in 1576 in Shoreditch by James Burbage. It was soon joined by The Curtain. Both are known to have been used by William Shakespeare's company. In 1599, the timber from The Theatre was moved to Southwark, where it was used in building the Globe Theatre in a new theatre district formed beyond the controls of the City corporation. Regarding theatre as sinful, these theatres were closed in 1642 due to the Puritans who would later influence the interregnum of 1649."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.35323474662275119203551847444407661639", "context": "After the Restoration (1660), theatre among other arts exploded, and two companies were licensed to perform, the Duke's Company and the King's Company. Performances were held in converted buildings, such as Lisle's Tennis Court. The first West End theatre, known as Theatre Royal in Bridges Street, was designed by Thomas Killigrew and built on the site of the present Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. It opened on 7 May 1663 and was destroyed by a fire nine years later. It was replaced by a new structure designed by Christopher Wren and renamed the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.\n\nOutside the West End, Sadler's Wells Theatre opened in Islington on 3 June 1683. Taking its name from founder Richard Sadler and monastic springs that were discovered on the property, it operated as a \"Musick House\", with performances of opera; as it was not licensed for plays. In the West End, the Theatre Royal Haymarket opened on 29 December 1720 on a site slightly north of its current location, and the Royal Opera House opened in Covent Garden on 7 December 1732. John Gay's ballad opera The Beggar's Opera ran for 62 performances in 1728, and held the record for London's longest run for nearly a century. It has been called \"the most popular play of the eighteenth century.\" Another musical show, Tom and Jerry, or Life in London (1821), was the first London production to reach 100 consecutive performances. Tom and Jerry'''s combination of a tour of London interspersed with song and dance, gave rise to numerous similar, loosely constructed entertainments, and \"planted the seeds for later musical comedy and revue\"."}, {"source": "bitagent.source.75381814543731362725934051195954395293", "context": "The Patent theatre companies retained their duopoly on drama well into the 19th century, and all other theatres could perform only musical entertainments. By the early 19th century, however, music hall entertainments became popular, and presenters found a loophole in the restrictions on non-patent theatres in the genre of melodrama. Melodrama did not break the Patent Acts, as it was accompanied by music. Initially, these entertainments were presented in large halls, attached to public houses, but purpose-built theatres began to appear in the East End, such as the Pavilion Theatre in Whitechapel.\n\nThe West End theatre district became established with the opening of many small theatres and halls, including the Adelphi in The Strand on 17 November 1806. South of the River Thames, the Old Vic, Waterloo Road, opened on 11 May 1818. The expansion of the West End theatre district gained pace with the Theatres Act 1843, which relaxed the conditions for the performance of plays, and The Strand gained another venue when the Vaudeville opened on 16 April 1870. The next few decades saw the opening of many new theatres in the West End. The Criterion Theatre opened on Piccadilly Circus on 21 March 1874, and in 1881, two more houses appeared: the Savoy Theatre in The Strand, built by Richard D'Oyly Carte specifically to showcase the comic operas of Gilbert and Sullivan, opened on 10 October (the first theatre to be lit by cooler, cleaner electric lights), and five days later the Comedy Theatre opened as the Royal Comedy Theatre on Panton Street in Leicester Square. It abbreviated its name three years later. On 23 December 1886, Alice in Wonderland (the first major production of the Alice books) debuted at the  Prince of Wales Theatre. Lewis Carroll attended a performance seven days later. Opened in 1892, the Duke of York's Theatre saw the debut of J. M.

The theatre was renamed the No\u00ebl Coward Theatre in 2006 after the playwright No\u00ebl Coward. Constructed in 1897, Her Majesty's Theatre hosted a number of premieres, including George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion in 1914. The theatre building boom continued until about the First World War.\n\nIn 1930, Laurence Olivier had his first important West End success in No\u00ebl Coward's Private Lives. A number of other actors made their West End debut prior to the Second World War, including John Gielgud, Alec Guinness and Vivien Leigh. During the 1950s and 1960s, many plays were produced in theatre clubs, to evade the censorship then exercised by the Lord Chamberlain's Office. The Theatres Act 1968 finally abolished censorship of the stage in the United Kingdom.\n\nTheatreland\n\n\"Theatreland\", London's main theatre district, contains approximately forty venues and is located in and near the heart of the West End of London. It is traditionally defined by the Strand to the south, Oxford Street to the north, Regent Street to the west, and Kingsway to the east, but a few other nearby theatres are also considered \"West End\" despite being outside the area proper (e.g. The Apollo Victoria Theatre, in Westminster). Prominent theatre streets include Drury Lane, Shaftesbury Avenue and the Strand. The works staged are predominantly musicals, classic and modern straight plays, and comedy performances.\n\nMany theatres in the West End are of late Victorian or Edwardian construction and are privately owned.

Furthermore, live music became optional for the first time in the contest's history. IBA took advantage of this and decided to drop the orchestra from the contest as a way to conserve money for the show. This meant that for the first time all entries used backing track during their performances.
